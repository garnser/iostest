Yes I have found my way around the email. I was wandering around and about to just drop in on you, but you were amidst some traffic and I would not be responsible for accidents. This email thing is great for quick correspondence but it is the making of horrid handwriting and impatience.</p>\n<p>I learnt about the email from a funny looking man while wandering. He was quite excited about the fact that <strong>we</strong> can get emails. He was American. I could tell by the way he spoke. But dear me he had on some ghastly clothes, and even ghastlier shoes. Overly underdressed!</p>\n<p>Oh the decline of style is the decline of humanity!</p>\n<p>I would not even be caught wearing them as undergarments. Strange name, Jobs. He was quite irritated at the fact that I knew him not. In fact he deemed me ignorant. But his arrogance was a sign, I felt of a sort of genius. He took me to one of those sleek shops selling what I thought was fruit. I did not know that Apples have evolved into cold inedible things. You should tell me these things so I do not look foolish before the younger ones.</p>\n<p>About tea, I can drop in on you anytime. I might have developed a taste for coffee but it is a bitter thing. I rather have a hot bowl of chocolate. A mexican lady served it to me once and I thought it to be just delightful.</p>\n<pre><strong>From</strong>: Raina Ng &lt;r.ng@email.com&gt;\r\n<strong>Subject: </strong> <strong>Tea?\r\n</strong><strong>Date: </strong> September 17, 2012 3:05:12 PM GMT+07:00\r\n<strong>To: </strong>Oscar Wilde &lt;owilde@stillaroundheresomewhere.univ&gt;\r\n<strong>Cc:</strong></pre>\n<p>Dear Oscar,</p>\n<p>I am looking for a way I could invite you to tea again.

Total marks awarded to myself: 100.<br />\nI think it is a nice round number, percentage-wise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I still have far more e-mail friends and contacts than I do Facebook friends. <strong>23</strong></li>\n<li>I have 50 folders with subfolders for clients, friends, memberships and so on. I could make some improvements. <strong>-3</strong></li>\n<li>I have sorted the Sent Items into their respective folders too. It is easy to follow correspondence this way. <strong>20</strong></li>\n<li>I last wrote a letter (via e-mail) to my parents in Australia 8 days ago. That is longer than one week. <strong>-10</strong></li>\n<li>I have flagged one minor task to attend to (revision of the second verse of a translation of a poem I did for fun, following the kind parsing in the source language by a friend). My integrity is at stake (\"Don\'t start something you have no intention of finishing\"). This attracts a modified negative grading, since only two people care. <strong>-8</strong></li>\n<li>All administrative tasks associated with my freelance business are up-to-date. <strong>25</strong></li>\n<li>I have replied to all e-mails received (except of course, junk mail). <strong>18</strong></li>\n<li>I have removed flags from items I have dealt with. <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have deleted outright things I know I will not read, even though they may be of some benefit, knowledge-wise. Too much information is too much information. <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have one e-mail I ought to write (as the initiator of private correspondence). Slap on the wrist for procrastination weighed against its relative importance: <strong>-5</strong></li>\n<li>I have not been able to figure out how to mute the volume on annoying adverts with sounds (or get rid of the adverts altogether) on the Internet, while still turning up the volume on my laptop so that I can hear when new mail arrives. This is annoying. I use a number of online dictionaries and other resources. I have trained my eyes not to look at the adverts, but cannot stand the Grim Reaper laughing at me with a written message in Portuguese asking me, \"Do you know when you are going to die?\". Even thinking about that tiny question would provoke a huge rant from me. I shall be kind to myself in this case. Firstly, I am suffering and secondly, I do not know if it is possible to achieve the desired removal of adverts. Total penalty: <strong>-2</strong></li>\n<li>With my volume on zero, I lost out on a job from a translation agency today because I did not check my inbox for over 30 minutes. I give myself 12 points for working for 30 minutes without being distracted at all, and have deducted 5 for losing out on potential income. Net result: <strong>7</strong></li>\n<li>While clearing out my mail box, and sorting into folders, I discovered three e-mails which I had received and replied to, but had no recollection of the names of the people who had sent them to me. <strong>-5</strong></li>\n<li>At this rate, I shall never get to 100 points. Points for stamina, then: <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have had the same e-mail name since I got my first e-mail account in 2000. Note: I did not really need an e-mail at home until then. Besides which, you needed a telephone line to have an e-mail account, and I did not have one of those at home either. Times have changed, service providers have changed, but the name before the @ is the same. Points to stability, I would say: <strong>15</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how Wordpress copes with the numbered list, and the font colours for the points (blue for positive; red for negative).</p>\n<p>One curious little note on a slang term (which I seldom used myself, not being very slangy by nature): In Zimbabwe years ago, if someone was really entertained with what you had just said, or pleased with the news you had just given them, they would say, \"Ah, 10 points!\". This awarding of points may have come from the fact that the only really interesting thing on television in the 1970s or so was the \"inter-schools quiz\". I don\'t know; I am guessing.</p>\n<p>A related expression was \"100%\", which signified agreement, and again, pleasure at the receipt of good news. This came into fairly widespread use around 2000. The expression soon changed to \"Ah, hundred\", or \"Ah, hundreds\", or simply, \"Hundreds\". One other theory I have on the shift from \"10 points\" to \"hundreds\" is that it was a reflection of the all-pervasive hyperinflation, and perhaps people thought that 10 was no longer a significantly grand number.</p>\n<p>In any case, I have scored 100 points. Hundreds.</p>\n<p>Allison</p>\n","excerpt":"<div class=\"full\"><img src=\"http://wrightonthebutton.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greenshot_mailbox.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-full\" /></div><p dir=\'auto\'>Thanks to the Post to Email challenge issued by Wordpress, I now have only one unread message in my e-mail folder.

As the teacher looked down at her book, or turned to use the blackboard, a student might tap the person ahead and hand the paper up, or slide it carefully onto the desk at the left. At last the paper reached its intended recipient, whose name was block printed on one of the exposed sides. Her task was to open it, near the front of the classroom, without attracting the notice of the teacher. The message had to reach her during class, or she would pass into the halls and on to her next class without the urgent information in the note.</p>\n<p>By ninth grade, I regularly carried messages (usually just verbal) from a friend in my gym class, to her boyfriend in my English class. When we went on high school or scouting field trips, we were given regular hourly intervals at which each meandering group would \"meet back\" with the rest at a common point to allow the group leaders to count heads. If we went out from home and were late returning, our parents worried and called around to our friends\' homes to find out where we were last spotted. (We were always scolded for not calling in on these occasions, as well.)</p>\n<p>Now, all of these things are handled using cell phones which can text, tweet, or email, in addition to just outright calling another person, to make sure no important communication is missed. We indeed live in interesting times.</p>\n<p>Now, in fact, electronic communication is so pervasive that we are seeking ways to limit it. Folks barely look up from their handheld devices as they cross a street, email boxes are full of \"spam\"/electronic junk mail, and we are rudely interrupted by phones ringing (and subsequent personal conversations) in restaurants, elevators, and other public places. Phones light up at the movies, distracting other theater goers, as an impatient recipient reads a text message that just can\'t wait. Television commercials warn against the serous dangers of texting while driving.</p>\n<p>Today, I read that Apple has received a patent to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"ipod limits\" href=\"http://myscienceacademy.org/2012/09/17/apple-granted-patent-to-disable-iphone-recordings-near-government-buildings-or-political-events/\">restrict iPhone recordings near government buildings and political events</a>. There is an outcry over this limitation of a freedom that, fifty years ago, was pure science fiction. So many benefits, so many issues.</p>\n<p>When I first had email, I rushed home to check my \"mailbox\" every night. Ten years later, I was so battered by the constant barrage of emails at work, and demands for immediate responses, that some nights I didn\'t even turn my personal computer on. Now I have a phone with texting and IM-ing, a laptop with email (three addresses for different purposes, neatly sorted by Outlook), Skype, Facebook and LinkedIn on both these devices and my Kindle Fire, and the ability to create and email a blog post from anywhere any time.</p>\n<p>These are all wonderful conveniences, but sometimes I just need to unplug. For the last five or six days I\'ve been travelling. I popped into my email and Facebook twice to \"keep up,\" and if a family member had needed to reach me, I had a cell phone. I didn\'t feel the immediate need to use another device or program. Of course, during that time I neglected my blog, but it was sort of restful.</p>\n<p>I don\'t Tweet, Facebook, or text my every move (I don\'t care for it when other people do this, so I won\'t burden them either.) I don\'t post my opinions on Facebook (after all this is meant as <em>social media -</em>and weren\'t we taught not to discuss religion or politics socially?) I have my blog for my random thoughts and opinions (which I post to a separate Facebook page for those who care.) I truly appreciate my friends and followers, and will try to get caught up this week - but I unapologetically enjoyed my e-vacation.</p>\n<p>So, in the event that I\'m somewhere away from home, perhaps on a prolonged trip, and I have an urgent need to communicate something on my blog, it will be wonderful that I have that ability from all of my electronic devices through email. I\'m giving that a try for the first time with this post, including using some “shortcodes” – for example to tag it. However, just because I <em>can</em> do something with one of these marvelous devices doesn\'t mean that I necessarily should, or will.</p>\n<p>Time will tell how useful some of these new tech advances will be for me, but who knows? These are, after all, very interesting times.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>\n<p><em>This post was written in response to the the WordPress <strong>Weekly Writing Challenge: Mail It In</strong>.

It was a very happy time for us and her addition to our family added to that joy tremendously.  Beatrice was a very special gift because she was so much more than just a dog.  She was full of light and happiness that you could truly see when she pranced into a room.  Bea\'s heart and her funny quirks inspired me to write this blog.  I called her my Sweet-Bea.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3129\" title=\"628x471\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"419\" /></a></p>\n<p>When we first got Bea, the intention was to show her.  Her lineage was quite impressive and her potential as a show dog was thought to be endless.  Unfortunately for Bea\'s career, her heart melted ours and the thought of her being on the road at shows, away from us, was too much to bear.  Beatrice was our little lap dog and her place was with us, at home.  Still, the demand for Bea\'s puppies was high and we had planned to breed her.  In the upcoming months she was to be bred to Baker (a.k.a \"Nautilus Boston Baked Beans\" a US and Canadian champion) with whom the puppies would have been remarkable.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, on our way back to San Francisco after a great summer vacation on the east coast, Beatrice lost her life due to the negligence of United Airlines.  I\'m writing this with my anger aside, in the hopes that someone looking for advice will read this and not make the mistake of trusting United with their pets as we did.</p>\n<p>Beatrice had a perfect health record.  She received a full examination and a health certificate four days before the flight, as is required by the Pet Safe program. This program is United\'s branded on-board pet safety program. In addition to Pet Safe\'s stringent requirements, we took every extra precaution we could think of.  Both the dog\'s kennels were labeled front to back with emergency numbers, flight information and warnings.  Their kennels were purchased specifically for the measurements and design specified by Pet Safe.  We purchased special water bowls which we filled with ice to ensure that the water wouldn\'t spill and that it would last longer. We drove the six hours to New York City from our house in Northern New York State, so the dogs wouldn\'t have to make a connecting flight.  We paid United Airlines $1800.00, in addition to our plane tickets, to ensure the safety of our pets. Albert and Bea were very prepared travelers.</p>\n<p>When we arrived in San Francisco to pick up our dogs we drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hanger were told simply, \"one of them is dead\" by the emotionless worker who seemed more interested in his text messages.  It took thirty minutes for a supervisor to come to tell us, \"it was the two year old.\"  Subsequently we requested that our dog be returned to us and were told that she had been delivered to a local vet for an autopsy. Whatever thread of trust remained between us and United broke and we then insisted that she be returned to us for our own autopsy by our trusted veterinarian, Shann Ikezawa, DVM from Bishop Ranch Veterinary Center. Over the next two hours the supervisor\'s lie unraveled as it became clear that Bea was right behind a closed door the whole time and he had been discussing how to handle the potential liability with his boss who had left and sticking to the divert and stall tactic that they had been taught. Eventually Bea was returned and we drove her to the vet at midnight.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3134\" title=\"35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>William Spangler DVM, PhD performed Beatrice\'s necropsy (a dog autopsy).  From the findings, it is Dr. Spangler\'s opinion that Beatrice\'s death was from  heatstroke.  Our little Beatrice died in pain, scared and alone.  Dr. Spangler also said that \"in my experience it is not unusual for a single dog in airline transit to be affected while other dogs of the same breed survive the trip apparently unscathed.\"</p>\n<p>It will be two weeks since Beatrice was killed by United Airlines and since then United has refused to give us any information about what happened to our beloved little Bea other then, \"our internal investigation does not show any irregularities, as evidenced by the fact that your companion dog and other animals on board did not suffer the same fate\".  I\'m not sure why the fact that the other dogs were not killed clears United Airlines but, they seem to think it does.</p>\n<p>They had nothing to say about the fact that the plane had been turned off  (for at least fifteen minutes each time) twice before take-off in Newark, nor did they have anything to say when I requested information about her placement in the plane or about baggage being packed around her.  United Airlines additionally called our veterinarian and fabricated a story about having an email from me, authorizing them to obtain the necropsy results. This, after I specifically told them that we would release the results to them at our discretion.</p>\n<p>Aside from being completely emotionally distraught over the loss of our little Bea, I am so saddened by the complete lack of competence,  honesty and compassion that United has shown.  I am not writing this to start a lawsuit or to get anyone to stop flying United.  I am writing this to help make people aware that airlines are incapable of ensuring the safety of our pets.  All it takes is for one employee to not follow the proper procedure and then like me, your dog is dead.</p>\n<p>I can\'t say exactly what happened to Beatrice on the plane two weeks ago.  If United had been able to be honest, it would have helped us to find closure.  All I know is what the necropsy told us, Beatrice died from heatstroke.  It is said to be an agonizing death.</p>\n<p>Beatrice should have been happy, healthy and spoiled with us for years and years to come.</p>\n<p>Please don\'t make the mistake I made that cost our dog her life.  Please, don\'t trust that an airline will truly care and provide safety to your beloved pet. At some point in the two hours that Bea was in the care of United Airlines before she died, someone made a mistake and because of that, our loving, happy sweet Bea is no longer in our lives.</p>\n<p>I will miss her forever.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3138\" title=\"Photo on 2011-06-30 at 19.14 #4\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thank you for supporting beamakesthree over the past few years, I greatly appreciate it and have really enjoyed everyone\'s comments.

This continues to be the case even as I shift to a new role, and now I wonder how Bhutan’s emerging middle class will aspire to consume.</p>\n<p>At a personal level, I try to be a conscious consumer. I am vegetarian because I know of the exponentially greater impacts of meat in terms of water and energy use. I weigh my purchases carefully, buying second-hand when I can and especially choosing quality and durability over quantity. I reuse when possible and then recycle to the point where it annoys most people.</p>\n<p>In my work over the past few years, one theme that has constantly come up is the role that geography and economic development play in sustainable consumption. With 7 billion people on the planet and an inevitable trajectory towards 9 billion, we can no longer be gluttons of consumption in feigned ignorance of the need to allocate resources fairly across the globe. Between now and 2030, 70 million people will join the middle class each year, moving out from under the rock of poverty and into the sunshine of consumption. With this will come increased demand for goods and services associated with a new middle class: mobile phones, washing machines, televisions, cars...</p>\n<p>We checked into our Druk Air flight to Bhutan with an embarrassing 150kg of checked luggage, all too aware of the hypocrisy of being conscious consumers with so much stuff. I brought three cameras, two suits, one bicycle and a lot of painfully selected outdoor clothing and camping equipment. The cognitive dissonance (and excess luggage fees) made us pack carefully, but still the supplies for a year in Bhutan added up.</p>\n<p>In Europe we were conspicuous with the amount of luggage we had, but upon landing at Bhutan’s international airport in Paro, we were quite surprised to find ourselves in good company. As the tourists picked their bags off and the Bhutanese gravitated in<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bhutanchronicles.com/2012/09/18/conscious-consumption-in-bhutan/rtk_0134/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-340\"><img class=\" wp-image-340 alignright\" title=\"Televisions\" src=\"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/v2/placeholder.gif\" original=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0134.jpg?w=450\" alt=\"More than half the pieces on the belt were giant LCD TVs\" width=\"288\" height=\"192\" /></a>to small clusters, the small airport’s only luggage carousel started filling up with boxes. Large and rectangular, box after box lay flat on the belt, their corners hanging over as they navigated the single u-turn on the belt in front of us, and finally I could read the magic letters: LCD. Fully half of the pieces on the carousel were 40 inch flat screen televisions, each soon to channel a nearly infinite amount of full-colour HD aspirations to Bhutan’s new middle class.</p>\n<p>Nearly every individual in this country grew up in an austerity that we cannot even imagine. No electricity, no running water, no refrigeration, no shoes, and of course no radio, television or internet. This was the norm for most of the country 30 years ago. While at a neighbour’s last night, we heard stories how our host, an accomplished artist who has traveled extensively to the United States over the past dozen years, remembers his first pair of Indian shoes with rubber soles which he only acquired as a grown man. Over dinner we were told of his encounter with an Amish community in Tennessee: He simply could not comprehend how a community surrounded by the 21st century would choose to ignore the benefits of light, electricity and the internal combustion engine.</p>\n<p>In turn, I try to understand our host’s antipathy for this conceit of the Amish, (and hide my own appreciation for their austerity). The fact that I haven’t owned a television in a dozen years and make conscious decisions to limit my consumption would probably not make sense to most of my fellow Americans; it would possibly make even less sense to someone in Bhutan who grew up without so many things we take for granted.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bhutanchronicles.com/2012/09/18/conscious-consumption-in-bhutan/rtk_0141/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-339\"><img class=\" wp-image-339 alignleft\" title=\"Baggage\" src=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0141.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0141.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"Arriving in Paro with a lot of baggage!\" width=\"315\" height=\"210\" /></a>After nearly five years exploring so many facets of consumption with business leaders and experts from around the world, everything that I have learned has been challenged within minutes of arriving into my new home country.

When kids are young and looking forward to a hot new toy, they sometimes try to approximate its presence in their lives by creating an <em>ersatz</em> model to take the place of the real thing until they can actually touch, hold, and use the real thing. Strangely, this is happening with increasing frequency to the iPhone. The tech world is so hungry for <em>anything</em> iPhone that they will contract graphic designers to create 3D models of the new gadgets, and even go so far as to build full physical models.</p>\n<p>The noise is deafening.</p>\n<p>Post after post featuring blurry component photos hits the interwebs, and the tech press gobbles them up like bacon-stuffed donuts. Most folks don\'t follow tech blogs, don\'t really have a pressing desire to know the internal layout of new gadgets, feel no need to really seek this stuff out. They read what falls in their lap and, usually, are better and more sane because of it.</p>\n<p>Then the device hits, and it elicits \"yawns\" from the peanut gallery because they\'ve already seen it all. They make sweeping (often literally global) statements about the reception of the product, about the excitement it\'s generated, etc. Their actions are, again, childish, just like the kid whose favorite team gets eliminated from the playoffs really early and starts claiming that no one likes [<em>insert sport here</em>] anymore, anyway.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, they\'re embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Who wouldn\'t be? Their phones are either knock-offs or faked. The real deal is just that, and consumers know the difference. Companies will try to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Not on the list: &quot;Runs the Best Mobile OS on the Market (iOS)&quot; (nope), &quot;Works with the App Store&quot; (nada), or &quot;Hasn\'t Shixpped Yet&quot; (check!)\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/1/3212328/lenovo-thinkpad-tablet-2-features-specifications\" target=\"_blank\">illustrate</a> how their products \"stack up\" against Apple\'s iPad, or iPhone, or whatever, but it ultimately just makes them look, again, juvenile. I can make a checklist that makes me look like the best human being ever compared to random people on the street. I could create a checklist of the features of a raw, uncooked potato, and compare it to all the features of a slice of deep-dish Chicago pizza, but comparing those two things would make no sense. \"Grows in the ground\", \"Has eyes\", \"Will sprout if placed in water\" are all \"features\" of the potato that the pizza doesn\'t have, but who really cares? I\'ll take the pizza thankyouverymuch.</p>\n<p>Which leads me back to my point. The leaked specs, the feature parity, the checklists, etc. are all meaningless in the face of true user experience and the whole package.</p>\n<p>A guy I know had his iPhone run over by a car. It was absolutely destroyed, which was sad for him. He was contemplating purchasing a replacement, but decided to wait it out until his contract was up for renewal so he could purchase a new iPhone 4S. In the meantime, someone gave him a Motorola Droid RAZR (or whatever it\'s called...these things have the weirdest names). He ditched the Droid in favor of an iPhone 3G. You read that right. He disliked the Droid user experience so much that he went with a molasses-slow (comparatively) phone, simply because the overall user experience was so superior. When you\'re on the losing team, shouting really loudly and making a lot of noise is still fun, sure, but it doesn\'t win you ball games. Just ask Cubs fans.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it\'s clear that people are jazzed about the iPhone 5, and all these \"yawn\" reactions are just the tech news equivalent of Cubs fans getting uppity. People will choose good design and a fluid, beautiful user experience over checklists and noise.</p>\n<p>As they say, it doesn\'t take a genius.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p dir=\'auto\'>There\'s something strange that\'s been happening in the world of tech as hotly anticipated products (primarily of the Apple variety) near launch: the world finds &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">600 more words, 28 comments, 43 likes, 1 link</p>","post_id":525,"guid":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525","permalink":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/embarrassed/","blog_id":"8729525","blog":"Musings of a Forgetful Panda","blogurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348258079,"comment_count":"28","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"1h","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=fb7974ab18","unlikeurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=fb7974ab18","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=8729525&amp;_wpnonce=e7aa917ee6","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=8729525&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=e7aa917ee6","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":8,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://en.wordpress.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpentimento.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Fjackstaff41.jpg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"tim","author_avatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f23dce32a50bee06a3d8bebd698f5c0e?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Flogo%2Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"Paul Grist: Serious Funny Books","content":"<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2798\" title=\"Let\'s put our bacon on the table.

Are there people out there who think that the only thing that stopped Bill Watterson being successful was that he didn\'t draw a realistic tiger? I just try to generate a readability, an immediacy, something that can be recognized and identified with.\"</p>\n<p>After a childhood following artists such as Mike Noble, Frank Bellamy and Gerry Haylock, Grist broke into comics via the UK\'s small-press scene. His first effort, Short Stories, came to the attention of DC Thomson\'s girls\' comics group, and the publisher offered him work within a week – a contrast to his failure to catch the eye of Marvel and 2000AD, which were proving to be tougher nuts.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps the lesson is that it\'s a lot easier to get into those comics that not many other people are aiming for. DC Thompson were great and kept me busy for a couple of years, working primarily on Nikki. I did short humour strips, quiz illustrations, and drew the cover strip for a year or so.\"</p>\n<p>A higher profile arrived in 1989 when Grist illustrated Grant Morrison\'s St. Swithin\'s Day, originally for Trident and later reprinted by Oni Press. Morrison\'s deliberately provocative mix of youthful unrest and anti-Thatcherite bile grabbed some headlines, but at least as much impact comes from the ink-heavy art and its unnerving high contrast. Grist\'s cartooning does exactly what McCloud describes, turning the troubled protagonist into an ambiguous, queasy mirror.</p>\n<p><strong>LIVING IN EDEN</strong><br />\nKane, the self-published story of New Eden\'s 39th Precinct and its officers, is where everything clicked. A long-form police procedural, with constant flashbacks to trip up the unwary and sub-plots that looked all set to tumble on forever, the shadowy past of Detective Kane was a sprawling canvas for Grist\'s imagination to work with.</p>\n<p>When it appeared in 1993, the comparisons were with David Lapham\'s Stray Bullets and Frank Miller\'s Sin City - Grist affectionately ribbed Miller\'s stories several times as he went along - but Kane was a chillier, more humane, and more effective strip. And for readers who found that New Eden\'s moustachioed SWAT team leader and his taste for excessive violence rang a bell, the strongest influence was clearly from another medium altogether.</p>\n<p>\"Hill Street Blues is very much the template for Kane: multiple storylines with a wide-ranging cast, and a mix of drama and comedy,\" agrees Grist. \"I loved doing Kane. I think in general if you\'re not working on your favourite comic then you\'re probably doing it wrong, and it certainly helped get me noticed within the industry.\"</p>\n<p>Grist\'s storytelling efforts in Kane were certainly noticeable, since he worked the page hard. One issue is told from a fixed vantage point on the rear seat of a patrol car; another makes do without speech or captions. A gangster speaks in a style on loan from Marlon Brando\'s Don Corleone, via phonetic speech balloons to be unpicked at leisure; Kane himself often says hardly anything. Officer Kate Felix, ever the voice of reason, gets one of the great stand-alone issues of any comic, a childhood incident and present-day crisis running in parallel.</p>\n<p>\"I just try to make the page visually interesting,\" comments Grist. \"Comics are a visual medium, so when people just put one square panel after another, I think they\'re really not using the medium to its full potential. To me that seems like dancing but not moving your feet.\"</p>\n<p>Kane was the definition of a cult hit, with vocal champions but not a huge readership. The book\'s narrative became extended by publication delays and threatened to grind to a halt, and some felt that the flashback structure was too hard to follow. \"Kane was very popular with the people who liked it, but sadly there weren\'t that many of them,\" says Grist looking back. \"Ultimately it just wasn\'t selling enough for me to be able to continue.\"</p>\n<p><strong>THE PAST IS NEVER DEAD</strong><br />\nAs Kane showed signs of fatigue, Grist responded with Jack Staff, originally aiming to attract readers and then draw them over to Kane. Hence a change of tack: from an American cop to a British superhero. But the tone was recognisably from the same pen.</p>\n<p>\"I tend to see my comics as being a mix of the sombre and the humorous,\" explains Grist. \"Serious funny books. Or funny serious books. Jack Staff is all about cause and effect, rather than nostalgia, but it\'s also about ageing and death. Jack Staff is someone who is alive forever; Becky Burdock, vampire girl reporter, is dead forever. And together they\'re facing the End of Everything. But that doesn\'t have to be a bad thing. You can still have a bit of fun along the road.\"</p>\n<p>If Kane was Americana, then Jack Staff is British to the core, loosely formatted in the style of past British action weeklies and seasoned with business from the UK\'s collective memory. A flashback to 1940 allows for a walk-on by the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, while the ambiguously spectral Helen Morgan addresses the reader from limbo and views the world through the Play School windows.</p>\n<p>\"I just throw in things that amuse me, really,\" comments her creator. \"None of the in-jokes or references to old British comic characters are important in terms of the story, it\'s just an extra layer for British readers of a certain age. I hope the story holds up in and of itself, and the fact that readers elsewhere can get it gives me some confidence that it does.\"</p>\n<p>The Americans at Image Comics got it, and picked up the book as a continuing series, leading not only to greater visibility for the strip, but also to a transition into colour.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, colour transforms the effect of Grist\'s art. The black-and-white Jack Staff is a contemplative, moody strip, sometimes given to introspection. The Image version is a full-colour Hellzapoppin\', in which anything goes, the layouts fizz, and the next figure around the corner may be demon, ghoul or giant talking goldfish.</p>\n<p>\"Eric Stephenson contacted me out of the blue and asked if I had ever thought about publishing Jack Staff at Image, to which the only honest answer was no. It  was only when they said that they wanted to publish it as a full-colour comic that it made sense to do it, since that gave me an opportunity to do something that I couldn\'t do with my own resources. Image also allows me to have everything in print at the same time, which as a self-publisher was something that was proving a bit of a juggling act.\"</p>\n<p>Grist had always wanted to include colour in Jack Staff: \"After all, it\'s a superhero comic, and superhero comics are always in colour. I like to think of the original series as being a colour comic with a lot of black-and-white pages. But I do still find myself in the mindset of drawing black-and-white pages which are then coloured in. I don\'t think a black-and-white page is simply a colour page without colour. That\'s a common mistake in comics, I think.\"</p>\n<p><strong>A PAPER MEDIUM</strong><br />\n\"In 1993 when I started doing Kane there were two big distributors plus several smaller ones, and there were less people actively making comics, so it was a bit easier to get noticed,\" says Grist. \"Now there is a single distributor which has tightened up a lot on what it will distribute, and which expects bar codes and all sorts of other professional malarkey that wasn\'t asked for in my day. I\'m not saying it is a bad thing that Diamond expects to approve the comics that they solicit for, but it makes it just a bit more difficult to get a new comic out there.\"</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the rise of the internet means it has become easier to get work seen by potential readers - whether or not the work is any good, or profitable. But fittingly for an artist with a taste for wrangling the fixed dimensions of a paper page, Grist feels no great urge to decamp onto the internet or create a web comic.</p>\n<p>\"As far as I\'m concerned, comics are a paper medium,\" he says. \"This may well be an age thing. I don\'t find reading comics on screen to be that interesting, so web comics are not something that I\'m really planning on exploring in the near future. I did serialise a comic I published, The Eternal Conflicts of the Cosmic Warrior, in a blog, but that was more a case of putting a paper comic on-screen than actually doing a comic for the web.</p>\n<p>\"After years as an active self-publisher, I\'ve now been published by Image for longer than I spent putting out my own books, so I’m really out of the loop as far as self-publishing goes nowadays. But one of the encouraging things about going to comic shows around the UK is that there are new, young people putting out their own comics. Twenty years ago you\'d go to the London Convention and the small-press section would be in a corridor leading through to the main hall. Now they\'ve become a main event in their own right. There\'s a lot of creativity out there, which is very encouraging to see.\"</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2810\" title=\"In the mouth of madness.

You can go anywhere in the world and find coffee and the culture that surrounds it.”</p>\n<p>I never for one moment doubted that statement. Coffee was something so personal to me, something that was more than just a warm cup; but rather an experience, emotional and physical, that I craved whether or not it was the caffeine driving it.</p>\n<p>My friends at home were jealous when I told them I was moving to Seattle. I saw the barista faces of my friends long for the opportunity to be surrounded by so much good coffee. While I refrained from telling them just how many Starbucks there were in the city, I did share in their excitement and look forward to experiencing the coffee vibe of this city for myself.</p>\n<p>Today when I woke up I knew that it was time to go to a coffee shop, alone, and see for myself what it felt like here. I know that buying coffee isn’t going to be something I can do on a regular basis, given the absurd price for a cup of joe in this city, but I was feeling lonely and I knew that something familiar would help me feel more at home in this city.</p>\n<p>What would make a barista feel more at home than a coffee shop?</p>\n<p>I opted for a coffee shop close to my aunt’s store called Zoka. As I walked through the large entrance I admired the beautiful woodwork and breathed in the familiar scent of coffee beans.  I noticed that the store was filled with other Seattle natives typing away on their computers or visiting with friends and smiled – this was a picture I was used to.</p>\n<p>When I stepped up to the counter and looked at their menu I refrained from blurting out “You do Pour Over’s too? We’re the only shop in Boise that does that!” though I’m sure my friendly barista would have smiled and not thought I was too weird because of it.</p>\n<p>I ordered my usual and scoped out a spot by the window where I could observe the people who came through the door. Young and old, students and couples, hippies and hipsters all walked through the door and looked like they belonged here. I wondered if I looked like I was supposed to be there too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-201\" title=\"IMG_3690\" src=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"397\" /></a></p>\n<p>My barista poured stunning latte art and I immediately sent a picture to my co-assistant manager back home, knowing he’d appreciate it. I felt another pang of loneliness knowing nobody was here to share this moment with me. But when I complimented my barista on her excellent pouring she smiled and we exchanged a few friendly words before I sat down to write.</p>\n<p>I may not know anyone in this town yet, but I feel comfortable with one of the biggest parts of the culture: coffee. Maybe I haven’t made any friends, but the friendly smiles of others in the coffee shop reassure me that I’ve learned the language here – it’s only a matter of time before I get to speak it with someone.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-202\" title=\"IMG_3692\" src=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zokacoffee.com/\">Zoka Coffee</a></strong></p>\n<p>2901 NE Blakeley Street<br />\nSeattle, WA 98105<br />\n206.527.0990<br />\nMon-Fri: 6am to 9pm<br />\nSat-Sun: 7am to 9pm</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir=\'auto\'>When I first started working at the District Coffee Shop, my boss told me “Coffee is a universal language.

It took no convincing for me to plan this for my students, realizing the impact it could have on their world perspectives. It is so challenging for students to grasp this immense planet and consider that they might \"make a mark\" on it!</p>\n<p>The story, if you are not familiar, is of a girl named Vashti who believes she cannot draw.  After being instructed to simply make a mark on the paper and sign it, she discovers that her teacher truly values that mark and Vashti challenges herself to create even more kinds of dots.</p>\n<p>On the Morning Message I told them to look for a piece of paper on their desks.  I had placed different colored dots in different locations on the paper and instructed the students to simply \"see where the dot takes you!\" So much interesting artwork resulted from the simple prompt.<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg\"><br />\n<img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"IMG_0541\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>                                  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"IMG_0542\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>After reading the book, we began to build the idea of the dot metaphor.  What does it mean to make your mark on the world? On our class? On our school? The idea was still a bit fuzzy to them, so we wrote about our talents, our smarts, (we have been exploring the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Intelligence\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple Intelligences</a>) and considered how these talents might help others around us.</p>\n<p>Then, we Skyped with another 3rd grade class at an international school in Berlin, Germany.  Lining up the time was tricky, since there was a 6 hour time difference. However, Ms. Victor (@victortweets) hosts a book club after school, so our group of 35 3rd graders got to talk to her 5 students attending the club that day!  I loved the dot activity they shared- their artwork displayed original dots each student created, representing different positive \"marks\" they wanted to make on the world...happiness, caring...etc.  This really helped my students to begin to generalize the idea of making your \"mark\".</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-540 aligncenter\" title=\"IMG_0532\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p> Finally, we extended this activity to relate to our classroom behavior by considering: What mark do we want to make on our classroom? Together we created a list of qualities we hoped our classmates saw in each other.  Our mission then was to create abstract artwork showing the mark we wish to make on our class community, a \"dot\" to represent the quality they hope their classmates see within. Last week we learned about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learningtogive.org/lessons/unit72/lesson3.html\">Random Acts of Kindness</a>, and I think connecting these random \"marks\" made will help them to understand even more, the power of their mark.</p>\n<p>They were so excited about the idea of \"connecting the dots\" between New Hampshire and Germany, and I could read amazement and disbelief on their faces that we were actually talking to other kids so far away...but seemingly so close. I look forward to capitalizing on the power of Skype to continue expanding the students\' worlds. While creating a dot to represent personal qualities is an extremely abstract thought, I knew that many students understood when they began writing and sharing their explanations of the art work.  Students considered size, color, placement, pattern etc. with regards to the represented quality.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-541 alignleft\" title=\"IMG_0539\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>                     <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-542 alignright\" title=\"IMG_0540\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Truly an experience with literal, metaphorical, personal, and global components.  Truly the way learning comes alive for learners.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related Posts</h6>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Day 2 in Review at #BLC12: Innovation is Questioning in Action\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/day-2-in-review-at-blc12-innovation-is-action-answering-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">Day 2 in Review at BLC \'12</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"#BLC12- Favorites from Day One: Choice and Assessment!\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/blc12-favorites-from-day-one-choice-and-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\">BLC \'12: Favorites from Day One...</a></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://childrensbooksheal.com/2012/08/27/international-dot-day-sept-15-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">International Dot Day - Sept. 15, 2012</a> (childrensbooksheal.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelamaiers.com/2012/09/promoting-student-engagement-make-your-mark.html\" target=\"_blank\">Promoting Student Engagement ~ Make Your Mark</a> (angelamaiers.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelamaiers.com/2012/09/skype-in-the-classroom-connecting-dots-between-schools-students-and-communities.html\" target=\"_blank\">Skype In the Classroom - Connecting Dots between Schools, Students and Communities</a> (angelamaiers.com)</li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://wordpress.com/imgpress?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peterhreynolds.com%2Fdot%2FsmDot.jpg&resize=84,84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir=\'auto\'>Monday was my first experience Skyping my class around the world!
