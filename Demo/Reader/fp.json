For school, a display on the Victorians, ready for a public event on Monday evening, was necessary. And I needed Victorian artefacts.</p>\n<p>I trawled the sources of Victorian wooden toys in my mind and decided wistfully that a trip into our local market town was going to be a must. I must make a wet, crowded, expensive drive, alone because everyone else in the house had colds.</p>\n<p>I braced myself. I got in the car. And I turned the ignition key, backed out of the drive and got on the road.</p>\n<p>I found a parking place in a great shopping cathedral and scuttled off through the fat drops of rain to the museum, a worthy red-brick building. I walked through the doors into a museum which, with the gloom outside, looked as if the caretaker had already turned half the lights out.</p>\n<p>My heart sank. Even one of my favourite sanctuaries felt abandoned.</p>\n<p>I located and bought what I had to. And then, I instinctively headed for the one exhibit with which I must commune, this rainy afternoon.</p>\n<p>It is two floors up, in a glass lift. I stepped out expecting to see no-one. There were a few straggling sightseers, grandparents with toddlers looking for rainy-day activity.</p>\n<p>I wandered into the Roman galleries: and there he stood. My battered Roman eagle.</p>\n<p>He is called the Silchester Eagle, and the Romans are thought to have thrown my eagle away for scrap.</p>\n<p>The cads.</p>\n<p>Silchester is the site of an old Roman town, Calleva Atrebatum. We've been digging it for well over a century: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/silchester/about-silchester/sil-about-silchester-calleva.aspx\">Reading's University oversees it </a>these days.</p>\n<p>My eagle was discovered a very long time ago, on October 9, 1866, by a clergyman. The Reverend JG Joyce, who excavated the dig from 1864-1878, was certain it was a very important eagle indeed: probably part of a Roman standard.</p>\n<p>And it was in this capacity that author Rosemary Sutcliffe used him to inspire her classic tale <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iEy1btLSKLAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">The Eagle Of The Ninth</a> , </em>published in 1954, a must-read for anyone who hasn't.</p>\n<p>In actual fact, research has revealed that he was once sitting on a sphere as part of a Roman ornament. Than the original craftsman was extremely skilled but subsequent repairs after accidents were clumsier. And that, according to his location, he was probably awaiting being melted down for scrap.</p>\n<p>Originally, my eagle had glorious great outspread wings, but no more. He is time-battered. But he has a circumspect air, as if really, it is all one could expect from life.</p>\n<p>He has seen a rainy afternoon or two.</p>\n<p>Here we stood, he and I, in a darkened room on a wet September afternoon. His attitude seemed to speak much louder than words. This is life, he said. You keep going, you tread each step, you serve your masters faithfully, spend years buried under ashes and lose a wing or two: and still, a kind of immortality can be yours.</p>\n<p>With a wisdom borne of more than a millennium of experience, I would swear he was smiling.</p>\n<p>Hello, Eagle, I said.</p>\n<p>Hello, he replied companionably.</p>\n<p>And then it was time to leave: to draw away from my eagle and trail reluctantly back to the gliding glass lift, leaving him amongst the coins and pots and tiles and remains of a city which died more than a thousand years ago. Time to come down from the mountain and rejoin life in the soggy streets of an English market town.</p>\n","excerpt":"<div class=\"full\"><img src=\"http://kateshrewsday.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_0240.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-full\" /></div><p dir='auto'>The heavens opened.

I know, people usually write about first loves, first cars and first jobs, but when you're hopelessly behind the curve . . .</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><strong>Fax Me the Pillow That You Dream On</strong></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Officially, it's known as a facsimile communications machine. Those on more familiar terms with it call it a fax machine.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I prefer facsimile communications -- it's formal, cold and aloof -- just the way I would like our relationship to remain.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Our relationship is new, and it's more of a brief encounter. I recently, for the first time, sent a facsimile to someone. It's worth noting that not only are a lot of people on a nickname basis with the thing, but they also have made a verb out of what was clearly intended to be a noun. It is important that every thinking person take a vow never, never to </span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><em>fax</em></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> anything.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I don't know if that someone to whom I sent the facsimile ever received it, but I did send it. I did it; it's over; I can get on with my life. It was this someone, of course, who instigated the whole thing, suggesting that this particular document needed</span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> to be rushed enough not to trust it to the vagaries of the postal service. I myself happen to be a fan of postal delivery. You stick something in an envelope, slap a stamp on it, and a few days later, a real human being, beaming with pride, delivers it to its destination. It's easy, it's fun and it's environmentally friendly.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">After determining the location of the nearest facsimile communication device and preparing the document in question, I sat down with paper and pencil to list pros and cons, possible dangers inherent in the action, and penalties for lack of action. I could</span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> remain defiant -- stick it in an envelope, slap a stamp on it, and let the chips fall where they may. That would have been a rational response, a consistent one, and the safe one. But as I prepared to lick the stamp, I noted that it portrayed tiny astronauts landing on a tiny moon. These brave explorers, these one-giant-leap-for-mankind heroes looked up at me as if to say \"Wimp!\"</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So even though I deeply distrust and avoid anything invented after 1967, I decided to go for it. It was a moment filled with emotional stress; breaking a technological barrier usually is. For those of you who have yet to screw up your courage and try it, I am happy to report that the anticipation is worse than the experience itself.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I removed the document from its mailing envelope, unfolded it, and inserted it in the rather harmless looking machine (quicksand looks harmless, too). I picked up the receiver of a rather ordinary telephone, dialed my recipient's number, and waited for my</span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> cue. The cue is an ear-shattering screech (just like, for those of you who remember the movie </span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><em>Fail Safe</em></span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">, the screech that came to the President of the United States over the hot line, indicating that our inadvertently launched nuclear missiles had reached the USSR, and Moscow was no more).</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Once the screech ends, you crawl out from under the desk, press a button, and the paper disappears into the machine. A minute later, it magically reappears. Presumably, the original has been divvied into millions of little molecules, each of which reprod</span></span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">uces itself. The clones are then fed through the phone lines to be reassembled at the other end and the original is reassembled here. I don't know. I do know the machine ironed the creases out of my document; I can vouch for nothing beyond that.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\"> <span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I may never send a facsimile again (and I will not fax) but it was worth experiencing. It fills one with that same heady exhilaration that diving to the ocean floor or landing on the moon must. And even though I may never send a facsimile again, I'm seriously considering giving the electric can opener a try. Technology is running amok, and it's sweeping me along with it.</span></span></p>\n","excerpt":"<div class=\"full\"><img src=\"http://richarddaybell.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/fax-machine1.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-full\" /></div><p dir='auto'>Apple's iPhone5 went on sale last Friday and sold out within nanoseconds.

Of course, most of us did, but we don’t feel the need to complain about it. Your next problem could be anything - your woman could have left you (the Lovesick Blues) you could have a hangover from last night’s pub-crawl (the 12-Bar Blues) or you might be tired after the walk uphill home (the Hill Street Blues). This problem will form the second line of your song.</p>\n<p>In case your audience don’t get it, the first and second lines are then sung again, before the verse ends with one line summing up just how bad the situation is. An example would be “Woke up this mornin’/Found ma woman gone/woke up this mornin’/found ma woman gone/Now I ain’t got no-one/to put ma dinner on.”</p>\n<p>It is important to note the use of the word “woman”. As a blues singer you are never left by your girl (that’s boy-bands), your honey (that’s Bobby Goldsboro) or your doll (that’s just weird). You will certainly never be left by your wife, because you won’t have one.</p>\n<p>All blues numbers have the same tune. This is a golden rule. The sole optional amendment is that a harmonica, the musical equivalent of nails on a blackboard, is sometimes thrown in, so that the listener’s agony can match that of the singer.</p>\n<p>This singer’s name will not be something like, say, Julian. No, blues singers have names like Silly Hair Jones, Bicycle-Pump Wilson or Old Yeller Jackson, who got the name not because he was a terrible singer, but simply because he was an old geezer.</p>\n<p>It is the only occupation in which you can call someone “Fats” without them getting offended.</p>\n<p>The typical blues singer lives to be about 120, singing night after night about their considerably more than fifty shades of blue.</p>\n<p>There is only one thing that they are afraid of, and that is happiness. Nothing can kill a blues career quicker than to wake up one morning, and find that things are good.</p>\n<p>Coz there ain’t no cure for the Funtime Blues.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p dir='auto'>Sidey's Weekend Theme is \"blue\", so here is Tinman's guide to one of the most famous of all music genres.... ***************************************************** The first &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">366 more words, 6 comments, 45 likes, 1 link</p>","post_id":10284,"guid":"http://tinman18.wordpress.com/?p=10284","permalink":"http://tinman18.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/song-sung-blue/","blog_id":"3941180","blog":"Worth Doing Badly","blogurl":"http://tinman18.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348507697,"comment_count":"6","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"1d","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://tinman18.wordpress.com/?p=10284%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","unlikeurl":"http://tinman18.wordpress.com/?p=10284%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=3941180&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=3941180&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":2,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://s1.wp.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgerryco23.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Foffa12.jpg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"Gerry","author_avatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4db4088fb4054ae42ae74053033a5ff7?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Fblavatar%2F69c64cd9e41f4f9ecb567a852bace934%3Fs%3D64%26d%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fs0.wp.com%252Fi%252Flogo%252Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"\"The Landscape Flowed Away, Back to Its Source.\"","content":"<div id=\"attachment_11851\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-1.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-1.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\" wp-image-11851\" title=\"Offa 1\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-1.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-1.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Offa's Dyke path: looking west to the coast</p>\n</div>\n<p>The weather map in the morning paper said it all: one oval isobar, a lazy ridge of high pressure lapping at the shores of the British Isles.

Six Iron Age hill forts are strung out along the highest points of the ridge, dating from about 800 BC to 43 AD. They vary in size, from the massive Penycloddiau (which we traversed on the first stage of this walk ) to the more compact Moel Arthur, the next peak along the ridge. They dominate the landscape now as they must have done in the past, though very little is known about these sites and their relationship to each other.  They probably served several functions - as military fortifications and villages, summer grazing land, meeting places and sites of ritual, and symbols of status.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11853\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-3.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-3.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\" wp-image-11853 \" title=\"Offa 3\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-3.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-3.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Penycloddiau: Bronze age burial chamber at the summit</p>\n</div>\n<p>Penycloddiau was built around 2,500 years ago - the largest hillfort on the Clwydian Range, and one of the largest in Wales.  There is a pond in the centre of the hillfort which may have provided water for the people living inside. Archaeological work has uncovered evidence of clusters of wooden roundhouses within the shelter of the banks and some around the pond. Farmers and craftspeople, skilled at weaving and metal working, would have lived in them.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa11.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa11.jpg?w=600\"><img title=\"Offa11\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa11.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa11.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /></a></p>\n<p>Penycloddiau has wide sweeping views up to the coast, so is likely to have attracted traders. There may have been regular markets where people came to buy and sell their wares: wool, hides, meat, elaborately decorated jewelry, weapons and tools.</p>\n<p>And there is evidence that there was a human presence here long before the Iron Age. At the northern end of the hill there is a Bronze Age burial mound which dates back at least 4000 years - almost two millenia before the hillfort.  A plaque on the side of the mound records that the grassy mound was reconstructed in 2010 to  protect the site of a Bronze Age burial chamber, built around 4000 years ago. The site would then have been a place of prayer and ritual where the cremated remains of important figures in the community were laid  to rest in special pottery beakers.  Like their descendants in the Iron Age, the Bronze Age people were farmers and the pond near the summit would have been highly valued and considered sacred. People gave offerings of livestock and  goods to the water gods to ask for protection and a good harvest.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-4.jpg?w=600\"><img title=\"Offa 4\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-4.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Penycloddiau: the reconstructed Bronze age burial mound</p>\n</div>\n<p>The excavation at Penycloddiau in 2010 that revealed the Bronze Age burial was carried out by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust.  The mound had been heavily eroded by the Offa's Dyke trail, which runs across the top of it and through the centre of the hillfort. Although no dating evidence was found, archaeologists could distinguish the mound as being Bronze Age.  One of the most obvious discoveries was a 'robbers' trench' - a large hole where the burial should have been - including a rectangular shape cut into the bedrock directly underneath the trench.  Unfortunately for the archaeologists, the robbers were good and took everything, not just treasure.</p>\n<p>It's difficult to convey the sheer scale of Penycloddiau: it covers 64 acres of fairly level grassland along the ridgetop.  Ambling slowly, drinking in the astonishing views, it can take half an hour to walk from the northern portal to its southern wall.  This aerial photo gives some sense of the extent of Penycloddiau.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11865\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 570px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/penycloddiau-hillfort-2.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/penycloddiau-hillfort-2.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-11865\" title=\"Penycloddiau Hillfort 2\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/penycloddiau-hillfort-2.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/penycloddiau-hillfort-2.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"646\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Penycloddiau Hillfort: aerial view</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\" wp-image-11854\">Leaving the southern ramparts of Penycloddiau, we followed Offa's Dyke path towards the next peak, Moel Arthur. Offa's Dyke is a massive linear earthwork that stretches 182 miles from Prestatyn to Chepstow in the south, roughly followed by parts of the current border between England and Wales. In places, it is up to 65 feet wide (including its flanking ditch) and 8 feet high. Its construction was ordered by Offa, King of Mercia from 757 to 796, one of the great rulers of Anglo-Saxon times, though his reign is often overlooked due to a limitation in source material.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-5.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-5.jpg?w=600\"><img title=\"Offa 5\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-5.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-5.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Offa's Dyke path: looking south towards Moel Arthur</p>\n</div>\n<p>We continued on the Offa's Dyke path as it descended steadily from Penycloddiau before passing through a stand of conifers to a valley where there is a parking place on a lane that leads back to Nannerch on the A541.  From here, the path makes a steep ascent to the summit of Moel Arthur.  We decided to leave that for another day.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-7.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-7.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-11857\" title=\"Offa 7\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-7.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-7.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" /></a></p>\n<p>We retraced our steps, climbing back up to Penycloddiau.  As I walked, treading ground harbouring the remains of human settlement over at least 4 millenia - the Bronze Age burial chamber, the Iron Age fort, the old Roman road that also crosses the ridge, and Saxon Offa's Dyke - the distant views were of 21st century intrusions into the landscape: the wind turbine arrays off the Welsh coast and in the Mersey estuary, the TV and mobile phone transmitter mast on the ridge, and, on the Cheshire plain, Jodrell Bank radio telescope, searching the universe for evidence of the beginning of time.</p>\n<p>In Geoffrey Hill's poem <em>Mercian Hymns</em> - in which history and memory are mixed, episodes from the life of Offa blended with memories of Hill’s own childhood, his experience of the Second World War and contemporary images from the time of writing in the late 1960s - there is a line which captures this sensation of time flowing through the landscape:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>the landscape flowed away, back to its source</em></p>\n<p><em>Mercian Hymns</em> is a sequence of thirty prose-poems inspired by the remnants of Offa's Mercia in the landscape. In Old English <em>Mercia</em> meant 'boundary folk', and the traditional interpretation is that the kingdom originated along the frontier between the native Welsh and the Anglo-Saxon invaders.  The main purposes of Offa's Dyke seem to have been to define the frontier between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms, and to control trade by limiting movement across the border to defined routes through the earthwork. It may have had an additional defensive purpose, but historians think that would probably have been incidental. Only unchallengeable power could have allowed such a great undertaking, and only in a climate of relative peace between Wales and Mercia could a work of such a scale be achieved. This has suggested to historians that it must have been an agreed frontier.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offas-mercia.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offas-mercia.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11866\" title=\"Offa's Mercia\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offas-mercia.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offas-mercia.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"407\" /></a></p>\n<p>In Geoffrey Hill's<em> Mercian Hymns</em> sequence of prose-poem hymns, the first hymn is a panegyric – ‘The Naming of Offa’ – and echoes the accolades that begin such poems in the Anglo-Saxon tradition.  Offa is similarly introduced with accolades: ‘King’, ‘overlord’, ‘architect’, ‘money-changer’.  Offa was a ‘money-changer’ in the sense that he introduced a new type of coin which became the standard for all subsequent coinage in the Old English period, and even after it.</p>\n<p>Offa's coins demonstrate that he was a contemporary of the powerful Frankish king Charlemagne and sought to stand up to him as an equal. The portrait on a typical coin shows Offa in the style of a Roman emperor with an imperial diadem in his hair.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-coin.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-coin.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-11878\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\" title=\"Offa coin\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-coin.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-coin.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"319\" /></a></p>\n<p>Offa reformed the Mercian coinage in the 760s to bring it into line with the new-style Carolingian penny. The broader, thinner silver coin became the standard denomination for some six hundred years. From now on all coins would carry the name of the ruler.  These coins weighed the same as Charlemagne’s and could have traded internationally at the same value.</p>\n<p>But even more significant is a unique gold coin minted by Offa, now in the British Museum.  It is one of the most remarkable English coins of the Middle Ages because it imitates a gold <em>dinar</em> of the caliph al-Mansur, ruler of the Islamic Abbasid dynasty. It has been suggested that the coin was designed for use in trade. Islamic gold dinars were the most important coinage in the Mediterranean at the time. Offa's coin looked enough like the original that it would be readily accepted in southern Europe, while at the same time his own name was clearly visible.</p>\n<p>Standing on Penycloddiau it seems extraordinary that beneath our feet are the remains of a kingdom that, nearly two millenia ago, linked traders who passed along and through the Dyke here with the rest of Europe, the Middle East and beyond.  And yet, as Geoffrey Hill observes at the conclusion of <em>Mercian Hymns</em>, Offa himself vanished from history, leaving behind coins ... 'and traces of red mud'.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11877\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gold-imitation-dinar-of-offa.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gold-imitation-dinar-of-offa.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\" wp-image-11877\" title=\"Gold imitation dinar of Offa\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gold-imitation-dinar-of-offa.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/gold-imitation-dinar-of-offa.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"419\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gold imitation dinar of Offa</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>From <em>Mercian Hymns:</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">I</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">King of the perennial holly-groves, the riven sandstone: overlord of the M5: architect of the historic rampart and ditch, the citadel at Tamworth, the summer hermitage in Holy Cross: guardian of the Welsh Bridge and the Iron Bridge: contractor to the desirable new estates: saltmaster: moneychanger: commissioner for oaths: martyrologist: the friend of Charlemagne.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">‘I liked that,’ said Offa, ‘sing it again.’</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">[...]</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-9.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-9.jpg?w=600\"><img title=\"Offa 9\" src=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-9.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://gerryco23.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/offa-9.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"836\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">VI</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">The princes of Mercia were badger and raven.

He's a private guy, and he probably won't love that I'm devoting an entire entry to him. But I'm doing it anyway. (What can I say, honey, you knew what you were getting into when you married me.)</p>\n<p>I've mentioned Mr. Weebles in many entries here, and you've even seen comments from the man himself. Now I want to tell you more about him.</p>\n<p>The first thing you need to know about Mr. Weebles that he is truly awesome. He doesn't even know how awesome he is, which makes him even <em>more</em> awesome.</p>\n<p>We've been married for almost 6 years---our anniversary is nigh---and we've been together for about 8 years total. Before I met Mr. Weebles, I had pretty rotten luck with relationships. During my dating life I encountered textbook examples of almost every disorder listed in the DSM-IV.</p>\n<p>And because dating in NYC is only slightly less painful than tweezing your legs, I decided to cast as wide a net as possible to meet guys. I went online. That's how I met Mr. Weebles. In fact, I saw his profile and wrote down his profile name so that I could write to him. But he beat me to it---I got a message from him the next day. And that's how it started.</p>\n<p>I knew pretty quickly that he was The One. Many, many years ago I asked my mother, \"How do you know when a guy is the right one?\" And she said, \"You'll just <em>know</em>.\" At the time I thought it was a load of horse shit (sorry Mom), but of course she was right. With Mr. Weebles, I just <em>knew</em>.</p>\n<p>He and I are very similar---sometimes when two people are so much alike it can cause friction, but in our case it's just comical. One of us will say, \"I want to use the brain today, you got to use it yesterday!\" because we finish each other's sentences and thoughts so often that it creeps me out in the best possible way. We get annoyed by the same things (although to be fair, he doesn't get nearly as annoyed as I do), our neuroses compliment each other's, we care about the same things, and we have the same sensibilities and opinions about how life should be.</p>\n<p>He puts up with my crankiness. He tolerates the fact that I'm a Yankee fan (he is not). He takes it in stride when I'm randomly bitchy. He humors me when I do silly things. He talks me off the ledge when I'm really upset or worried. And I'm very lucky to have found a guy who can cook, is handy around the house, takes out the trash more often than I do, and often gets my coffee ready for me in the morning when I'm running late. Plus, he's 6'3\" so he can reach stuff on the top shelves.</p>\n<p>Mr. Weebles is a very funny guy. He doesn't just make me laugh---he makes me <em>cackle</em>. I don't know how he thinks of half the stuff he says. His brain just works so quickly, and it works in amazing ways. He'll make some off-the-cuff comment about something on television or whatever, and invariably it will be the cleverest, funniest thing I ever heard. (Until the next time he says something clever and funny.) I always wonder, \"How does he DO that??\" And he has one of the most creative minds of anyone I know. If you could attach a megaphone to his head and hear him think of things, you'd laugh your ass off at how funny he is and how many great ideas he has.</p>\n<p>He's the kindest, most decent soul I've ever known. I don't mean that in a treacly sort of way. I mean that he is truly the best person I know. He has an extremely honest, caring, and thoughtful nature. There is more integrity in his toenail clippings than many people have in their entire bodies. And he has a great deal of compassion. Stories about injustice upset him deeply. He's far more savvy about world events and politics than I am, so he knows about all the awful things going on here and around the world. When he hears about the latest corruption scandal or about people who are being mistreated in some way, he gets riled up to the extent that you'd think it happened to him personally. And I mean that as a compliment; it's one thing to think, \"Gee, what a shame,\" but it's another thing to contemplate how these miscarriages of justice affect us all somehow. Mr. Weebles does that. If he were ever to inflict pain on someone, it would be because that person deserved it in spades.</p>\n<p>But the acid test, of course, for determining whether people are truly good, is seeing them interact with animals. When Mr. Weebles and I first started dating, I had a cat whom I'll call Kitty Emeritus because she's in the Great Catnip Patch in the Sky now (although she never did like catnip so I'm not sure how thrilled she is about that). Kitty Emeritus was a fearless cat with a ridiculously well-developed sense of entitlement. You had to work hard to impress her. She was friendly and tolerant of every human I ever saw her with, and she usually gravitated towards men (I was so proud of her for that). But she <em>loved</em> Mr. Weebles. And the three cats we have now---the Weeblettes---also love him like crazy. They climb all over him and follow him around the house. And as anyone who has ever had a cat knows, when you have the love and trust of a cat, it's because you've <em>earned</em> it. Mr. Weebles has earned it and then some. He's the best Kitty Daddy a feline could hope for.</p>\n<p>But wait! There's more!</p>\n<p>I learned that the awesome Mr. Weebles is more extraordinary than I even knew already. I found out in a way that people shouldn't have to find out, but sometimes these things happen.</p>\n<p>Last year Mr. Weebles was diagnosed with cancer, at the age of 40. Ironically---and cruelly---this cancer was a long-term side effect of the radiation treatment he received for an entirely different type of cancer when he was 21. Last summer he went through surgery, radiation (different type of radiation than the first time, fortunately), and chemotherapy, and now he's doing great with an excellent prognosis. Overall it could have been much, much worse, but it still sucked pretty royally. For those of you who have cared for sick loved ones, you know how awful it is to see them suffer. It was brutal, knowing there wasn't much I could do while Mr. Weebles went through treatment. All I could do was focus on the light at the end of the tunnel and keep him as comfortable and as stress free as possible in the meantime.</p>\n<p>What I discovered, though, was that Mr. Weebles is one tough hombre. Even tougher than I thought. He's fucking badass. The radiation and chemo regimen he endured was nasty. He hated going through treatment, but he did it. And he did it with class and dignity.</p>\n<p>If I were in his shoes, I would have been spitting fire. Having cancer? <em>Again</em>? At the age of <em>40</em>? Because of the treatment for the first cancer? I would have been mad at the entire world. I would have been a raging, self-pitying, sobbing basketcase and I would have been mean as hell.</p>\n<p>But not Mr. Weebles. He was very upset, of course. And as far as I'm concerned he would have had every right to be a raging, self-pitying, sobbing basketcase himself. But he just has a different perspective on things---maybe because he's been through this before, maybe not. Doesn't matter. He just did what he had to do. And he was still polite to everyone. He was like a cowboy who rides into town, gets into a vicious shootout with the bad guys, drives them out of town, and then tips his hat, riddled with bullet holes, saying, \"Bye, folks, be seein' ya.\" Fucking badass.</p>\n<p>Watching him go through such an ordeal gave me an even greater appreciation for him and everything he's about. I'm insanely proud of him. He inspires me to be a better human being. The world needs more people like Mr. Weebles.</p>\n<p>If I could just get him to wear a combat uniform or some sort of Victorian gentleman's outfit, he'd be perfect.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p dir='auto'>You may have read this already---I linked to it recently, and some of you may have read it when I originally posted it back in &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">1,470 more words, 147 comments, 146 likes</p>","post_id":1291,"guid":"http://fearnoweebles.wordpress.com/?p=1291","permalink":"http://fearnoweebles.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/theres-something-about-mr-weebles/","blog_id":"33043698","blog":"Fear No Weebles","blogurl":"http://fearnoweebles.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348551137,"comment_count":"147","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"15h","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://fearnoweebles.wordpress.com/?p=1291%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","unlikeurl":"http://fearnoweebles.wordpress.com/?p=1291%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=33043698&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=33043698&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":4,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://s0.wp.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fjbodotnet.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Ffrogs.jpg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"J-Bo","author_avatar":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/56731d841905e6ebd12d938faac012fb?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Flogo%2Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"Buyxiety","content":"<p>Buyxiety: Part 2 in a 3-Part Series of my Anxiety.</p>\n<p>I get extremely anxious when I buy things. Unavoidable and expensive purchases such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://j-bo.net/2012/08/19/a-tale-of-two-couches/\">car repairs</a>, cat vaccinations, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://j-bo.net/2012/07/22/cincinnati-homeboy-and-the-traveling-salesman-2/\">tickets to ride a Greyhound bus across the country</a> make me nauseous.</p>\n<p>This means I’m good at saving money. I buy things used, never spend more than $15 on any article of clothing, and am driving the same ’98 Mazda I’ve had since before I got my license.</p>\n<p>This also means I’m terrible at spending money without convulsing at the register and succumbing to fits of buyer’s remorse that leave me debilitated on my bedroom floor for half a day.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve been trying to decorate my new office at work.</p>\n<p>“I bet you have a lot of stuff in your car to bring in,” my boss said on my first day.</p>\n<p>Uhhh, not exactly. (You might recall that I’ve spent the past year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://j-bo.net/2011/07/16/pee-spraying-babies-and-caricatures-of-the-elderly-my-volunteer-adventures-continue/\">getting peed on by babies in the slums of India</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://j-bo.net/2011/11/08/top-14-signs-its-time-to-quit-a-therapy-start-up-and-reasons-you-should-look-up-your-bosss-public-records-before-accepting-a-job/\">unknowingly working for a drug dealer</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://j-bo.net/2012/04/18/adorable-dog-that-helps-kids-read-aka-my-arch-nemesis/\">begging to be allowed to conduct therapy sessions in storage closets</a>. Beginning a collection of office decorations had not ever crossed my mind. Not once).</p>\n<p>My co-worker with the Hollywood-themed office came into my office the next day and closed the door behind her. “I think it’s so great you’re here,” she said. “But I just think you should know that the counselor who had this office before you worked here for five years and killed himself two months ago. So this office has just been really empty and sad since then. So it’s going to be so much less depressing for everyone once you start to decorate it and really make it your own.”</p>\n<p>Holy. Shit. Not good news for someone who believes that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://j-bo.net/2012/08/30/fresh-start/\">walls can have unresolved feelings</a>.</p>\n<p>That night I was browsing paintings on Etsy and wondering why everything cost a month’s-worth of rent until I realized that I could filter my search by price. Then I wondered why everything in my price range looked like something a five-year-old could draw with their non-dominant hand.</p>\n<p>I walked out of my early doctor’s appointment the next morning right into a random art sale filled with really cool paintings. It felt like it was meant to be. But they were a bit pricey by my standards, seeing as the only painting I’d ever purchased before was at Hobby Lobby for $6.</p>\n<p>A guy who worked there came up to where I stood, paralyzed with indecision. “If you get home and decide you don’t like it,” he said, “You can bring it back for a full refund.”</p>\n<p>That was enough for me to finally decide to get two. “How long do I have to bring them back?” I asked as I was digitally signing my receipt.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-four hours,” he said. I froze mid-signature. What if I didn’t wake up in time tomorrow? What if I went to get them out of my office late tonight and couldn’t get into my building? What if I damaged them taking them to or from my car? What if I had a terrible, debilitating accident in the next twenty-four hours and couldn’t return them and also couldn’t earn any money for the rest of my life?</p>\n<p>“Have a great day!” he said, handing me my copy of the receipt that had printed out with only half my signature on it.</p>\n<p>“I’ve made a horrible financial decision!” I shouted to Doug as I walked through the door. “We can’t eat for two months!”</p>\n<p>He didn’t seem too concerned but I felt the need to justify anyway. “But I’ll have these paintings in my office for the rest of my professional life,” I said. “So it’s an investment, right?”</p>\n<p>“Not really,” he said. “Do you know what ‘investment’ means?”</p>\n<p>“Aaaaaaaaah,” I moaned, wrapping my arms around my chest, pulling my hair around my chin, and rocking back and fourth to self-soothe.</p>\n<p>I spent the rest of the morning looking up what my paintings cost on other web sites and calculating what the additional costs of shipping and framing would be to convince myself that what I paid was actually a steal, considering mine came with high-quality frames and no glass so therefore no glare, and wasn’t no glare worth an extra dollar a year (if I divided the extra cost of mine by the number of years I will potentially work in an office)?</p>\n<p>I hung them in my office that afternoon. But then I thought: What if they are <em>too </em>fancy for an office setting? And I’m just that snotty girl whose paintings are just a little too fancy?</p>\n<p>I walked down the hall pretending I was on my way to the bathroom so I could peak into other peoples’ offices. Nobody else’s paintings had frames, they were just canvases- probably that they painted themselves! What if it was universally understood that frames are for living rooms, not offices, and I’m the only person who didn’t know this, and now I have created an awkward living room/office hybrid?</p>\n<p>I went back to my desk and did a Google image search of “office paintings.” A-ha! One of the first pictures that came up was of an office with framed paintings at least as fancy as mine. But then I clicked on the picture and realized it was one of the offices in the White House. Dammit!</p>\n<p>Then I closed out of the internet entirely because I started worrying that someone would walk by and see me Googling “office paintings,” and my computer is super slow at closing windows so by the time someone stepped inside my office it would be too late.</p>\n<p>By the time I woke up the next morning, the 24-hour mark had passed. I breathed a sigh of relief that there was no decision left to be made. I went to work, looked up at my paintings, and smiled. I really like them.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/frogs2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-573\" title=\"VLUU L200  / Samsung L200\" src=\"http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/frogs2.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/frogs2.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"524\" height=\"393\" /></a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/long-painting.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-574\" title=\"VLUU L200  / Samsung L200\" src=\"http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/long-painting.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/long-painting.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"524\" /></a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://j-bo.net/2012/09/11/an-exploration-of-my-neuroticism-part-1-of-a-3-part-series/\">Part 1 of 3: Catxiety</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/frogs2.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://jbodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/long-painting.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>Buyxiety: Part 2 in a 3-Part Series of my Anxiety.

Grow things. There wasn’t a plumber to call when something broke.  It may not have worked perfectly, but it worked and we made it.   <strong>Mettle</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2147\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://brigittebanter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/amazingpeoplewithmettle.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://brigittebanter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/amazingpeoplewithmettle.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2147\" title=\"AmazingPeopleWithMettle\" src=\"http://brigittebanter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/amazingpeoplewithmettle.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://brigittebanter.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/amazingpeoplewithmettle.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"168\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Just a few people who used their mettle.

So I began my evil plan.</p>\n<p>I had two choices for college. One was an Ivy League college that I didn’t exactly like and, as it turned out, didn’t exactly like me.  The second was the University of Rochester in upstate New York. It was filled with friendly people who let me stay with them for a weekend and drink--much better marketing.  And this school <em>just so happened</em> to have a music school attached to it—the Eastman School of Music.  It was a postern of fate.</p>\n<p>Had I told anyone—a single soul—about my plan to attend the Eastman School of Music they’d have committed me on the spot<em>.</em>  Eastman was one of the Big Three. It required some element of musical preparation or training. But I was going to take it completely off guard.</p>\n<p>In order to go to the Eastman School of Music, one had to apply, audition, and be accepted, which presumably meant it was necessary to be a master of at least <em>some</em> particular instrument. Those who went to Eastman not only started their training two years prior to conception, they practiced every day for twenty-six hours, forgoing even basic nutrition for music, which they considered sufficient nourishment for the soul.  They talked about Beethoven incessantly and threw birthday parties for Mozart instead of for themselves.  Their idea of a fraternity party was to get together at night and contemplate Brahms some more over a bowl of chips that had grown stale because everyone was too busy discussing Brahms  to actually eat them.</p>\n<p>I, on the other hand, could neither read nor hand-write music—and as a result, I spent a great deal of my time cheating my way through like an illiterate person reading road signs.  Every once in a while, you get one very, very wrong.  “Sorry, chief—that said ‘one-way.’”</p>\n<p>This wasn’t going to be easy—disguising myself as a musician and getting into what I still did not realize was the premiere classical conservatory in the nation. I would need a loophole, and that's just what I found.  Rochester students could take music courses at Eastman.  What if I just registered for <em>all the good music courses?</em>  Eastman students were there, and the classes commingled.  I could take almost the same classes with the Future Musicians of America, join bands with them, discuss Brahms with them, scoff at the poor slobs majoring in pre-med, economics, and history, and be musically, intellectually, and socially superior to the entire universe.  And I wouldn’t even have to be properly trained—it was a win-win situation by any stretch of the imagination.</p>\n<p>Thus, I registered for classes at the Eastman School of Music through the regular university. Totally legal. I studied all the theory I could muster and passed the exam through rote memorization, because that’s what academic people without “proper musical training” do.  Then—on the day of truth—I showed up for my audition.</p>\n<p>I was playing what some would consider a challenging piece—Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto.  I couldn’t actually <em>read</em> the score, so I bought a record—the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir George Solti—and read alongside the record—sort of a closed caption for the musically impaired.   I practiced for the entire summer before on my borrowed clarinet, because I was neither good enough nor well-funded enough to own one, and went off to college.</p>\n<p>Audition day. Imagine the panel of musical geniuses waiting to hear the next lead of the Boston Philharmonic. Imagine that they have just endured a thousand auditions—the next Yanni, the next Yo Yo Ma, next Chris Botti…and then…there…was me.</p>\n<p>Twenty years later, I am truly remorseful for the sorrow I inflicted on these men and I include them in my daily prayers.  I ask the Lord for forgiveness and to make their lives better in some subtle way.  If I were Jewish, I’d track them all down on Yom Kippur and beg them to accept my apology outright, because after hearing me, they were never quite the same.  I’m convinced that I took a little piece of music from each and every one of their souls and trampled on it like Marilyn Manson at a Boston Pops concert.</p>\n<p>At the end of what they must have thought was a Candid Camera prank or a CIA torture training mission (miraculously cut short because God Himself sped down into that hallowed hall, and broke my clarinet in half), all the men could do was look straight ahead, pause, and say, “So, you like Sir George Solti.”</p>\n<p>I steeped myself in everything Eastman. I laughed at the Beethoven jokes; I walked laps around the Gilded-Age auditorium. I went to concerts.  I breathed in the stale air of the practice rooms.  Even though it took me a 45 minute ride on the blue bus, I took a work-study job at the Sibley Music Library, where I began cataloguing music scores for less money than I would have made in a prison laundry, getting highly indignant—alongside the other Brahms lovers—when people misalphabetized the Russian version of Shostakovich  and put Von Weber under “w.”</p>\n<p>After that, it took me exactly two weeks to flunk entirely out of the music program, which I <em>still</em> did not realize was <em>the</em> best program in the nation.  I called my former band director who had inspired me to tell him I was struggling at Eastman and I feared I most probably would not succeed.</p>\n<p>“YOU DID WHAT?” He didn't sound impressed.  And so I came clean. I divulged the whole story—of my sneaking onto the “Eastman” rosters under cover of darkness, of my torturing the great musicians on the panel taking musical years off their lives. How I got a 40 on my first assignment, major scales, and a 20 on minor scales, and that was only because the infinitely good Dr. Harrison said, “You didn’t <em>earn</em> that 20—but I can see that you tried <em>really hard</em>.”</p>\n<p>In the end, the stress got me sick.  I was sick for a solid month. I shuffled back and forth to health services.  I commiserated with my yet-to-be-premed friends, with whom I now spoke since Brahms was giving me the cold shoulder, and I plugged through the rest of first semester before finally admitting I was not musician material.</p>\n<p>The discipline of “proper training” made music seem more like another aspect of calculus than the soul and essence of life.  It became a self-torture I couldn’t stop—a train wreck—the part of a mountain climb where it seems that the summit is right around the corner, but when you pass the next tree, you see the ridgeline open up and reveal it to be so far in the distance that you’re not sure you want to press on.  When you ultimately decide to continue and you arrive at the next point where you thought the summit would be, it turns out to be an illusion once again.  I was left with the sinking feeling of defeat and disappointment, where the thing I thought I loved—the passion in my soul, turned out to be one giant red herring.</p>\n<p>I didn’t even get into the lowest of piano courses—the one <em>everyone</em> takes.  My audition turned out to be surprisingly similar to my clarinet audition.  The professor said, “Very good,” when I played the Mozart, and then, “Read this,” handing me some Chopin that looked like Chinese Braille.  Game over.</p>\n<p>I was forced to finish that semester in clarinet.  I continued to travel over to Eastman to study with my personal graduate student, Michelle, who was undoubtedly in trouble for something and had to redeem herself by teaching me.  I sincerely hope she is not working in a sub-par elementary music program soon to be cut.  She was an angel.  She made me feel good.</p>\n<p>I played one semester in the River Campus Symphonic Wind Ensemble, being too ignorant to know that it was an entire year commitment until my conductor found me and said, “WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?”  By that time I supposed the loss of one more third clarinet was probably a blessing to everyone.</p>\n<p>I sang Gospel during the rest of my tenure at school—one of two white people in that group.  Gospel I could handle—no music reading, a history of musical improvisation, and fun group of people with a conductor, Dr. Alvin Parris, who demonstrated that music was a gift from heaven channeled through people regardless of “proper training.”  In this group, I learned some technical skills, and had the experience of being the only person of another race in a large overpowering majority—I experienced the smallest sampling of the struggles with which my choir members lived constantly, the subtle infusion of racism that permeated their very existence, from which I could escape but they could not.  That was a gift I carry with me to this day.</p>\n<p>I left music behind with a better understanding of the timeless cliché, “Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.”</p>\n<p>Today, music has returned to my life. I see the beauty, joy, and patterns in nature.  I pick up my guitar and write, sing, and play on my terms.  I write satire, folk, and other pieces of no particular consequence that will never be produced for the betterment of humanity.  I have sung a roast or two, and I freestyle with my students when directly challenged. I always win.</p>\n<p>And I am grateful for my failure. I am happy with my music.  Once again, it brings me great joy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p dir='auto'>I wanted to be a professional musician, but I did not have the chops.

Yes I have found my way around the email. I was wandering around and about to just drop in on you, but you were amidst some traffic and I would not be responsible for accidents. This email thing is great for quick correspondence but it is the making of horrid handwriting and impatience.</p>\n<p>I learnt about the email from a funny looking man while wandering. He was quite excited about the fact that <strong>we</strong> can get emails. He was American. I could tell by the way he spoke. But dear me he had on some ghastly clothes, and even ghastlier shoes. Overly underdressed!</p>\n<p>Oh the decline of style is the decline of humanity!</p>\n<p>I would not even be caught wearing them as undergarments. Strange name, Jobs. He was quite irritated at the fact that I knew him not. In fact he deemed me ignorant. But his arrogance was a sign, I felt of a sort of genius. He took me to one of those sleek shops selling what I thought was fruit. I did not know that Apples have evolved into cold inedible things. You should tell me these things so I do not look foolish before the younger ones.</p>\n<p>About tea, I can drop in on you anytime. I might have developed a taste for coffee but it is a bitter thing. I rather have a hot bowl of chocolate. A mexican lady served it to me once and I thought it to be just delightful.</p>\n<pre><strong>From</strong>: Raina Ng &lt;r.ng@email.com&gt;\r\n<strong>Subject: </strong> <strong>Tea?\r\n</strong><strong>Date: </strong> September 17, 2012 3:05:12 PM GMT+07:00\r\n<strong>To: </strong>Oscar Wilde &lt;owilde@stillaroundheresomewhere.univ&gt;\r\n<strong>Cc:</strong></pre>\n<p>Dear Oscar,</p>\n<p>I am looking for a way I could invite you to tea again. Screaming and shouting my invitation like the way I did that time has distressed some neighbours.

Total marks awarded to myself: 100.<br />\nI think it is a nice round number, percentage-wise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I still have far more e-mail friends and contacts than I do Facebook friends. <strong>23</strong></li>\n<li>I have 50 folders with subfolders for clients, friends, memberships and so on. I could make some improvements. <strong>-3</strong></li>\n<li>I have sorted the Sent Items into their respective folders too. It is easy to follow correspondence this way. <strong>20</strong></li>\n<li>I last wrote a letter (via e-mail) to my parents in Australia 8 days ago. That is longer than one week. <strong>-10</strong></li>\n<li>I have flagged one minor task to attend to (revision of the second verse of a translation of a poem I did for fun, following the kind parsing in the source language by a friend). My integrity is at stake (\"Don't start something you have no intention of finishing\"). This attracts a modified negative grading, since only two people care. <strong>-8</strong></li>\n<li>All administrative tasks associated with my freelance business are up-to-date. <strong>25</strong></li>\n<li>I have replied to all e-mails received (except of course, junk mail). <strong>18</strong></li>\n<li>I have removed flags from items I have dealt with. <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have deleted outright things I know I will not read, even though they may be of some benefit, knowledge-wise. Too much information is too much information. <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have one e-mail I ought to write (as the initiator of private correspondence). Slap on the wrist for procrastination weighed against its relative importance: <strong>-5</strong></li>\n<li>I have not been able to figure out how to mute the volume on annoying adverts with sounds (or get rid of the adverts altogether) on the Internet, while still turning up the volume on my laptop so that I can hear when new mail arrives. This is annoying. I use a number of online dictionaries and other resources. I have trained my eyes not to look at the adverts, but cannot stand the Grim Reaper laughing at me with a written message in Portuguese asking me, \"Do you know when you are going to die?\". Even thinking about that tiny question would provoke a huge rant from me. I shall be kind to myself in this case. Firstly, I am suffering and secondly, I do not know if it is possible to achieve the desired removal of adverts. Total penalty: <strong>-2</strong></li>\n<li>With my volume on zero, I lost out on a job from a translation agency today because I did not check my inbox for over 30 minutes. I give myself 12 points for working for 30 minutes without being distracted at all, and have deducted 5 for losing out on potential income. Net result: <strong>7</strong></li>\n<li>While clearing out my mail box, and sorting into folders, I discovered three e-mails which I had received and replied to, but had no recollection of the names of the people who had sent them to me. <strong>-5</strong></li>\n<li>At this rate, I shall never get to 100 points. Points for stamina, then: <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have had the same e-mail name since I got my first e-mail account in 2000. Note: I did not really need an e-mail at home until then. Besides which, you needed a telephone line to have an e-mail account, and I did not have one of those at home either. Times have changed, service providers have changed, but the name before the @ is the same. Points to stability, I would say: <strong>15</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how Wordpress copes with the numbered list, and the font colours for the points (blue for positive; red for negative).</p>\n<p>One curious little note on a slang term (which I seldom used myself, not being very slangy by nature): In Zimbabwe years ago, if someone was really entertained with what you had just said, or pleased with the news you had just given them, they would say, \"Ah, 10 points!\". This awarding of points may have come from the fact that the only really interesting thing on television in the 1970s or so was the \"inter-schools quiz\". I don't know; I am guessing.</p>\n<p>A related expression was \"100%\", which signified agreement, and again, pleasure at the receipt of good news. This came into fairly widespread use around 2000. The expression soon changed to \"Ah, hundred\", or \"Ah, hundreds\", or simply, \"Hundreds\". One other theory I have on the shift from \"10 points\" to \"hundreds\" is that it was a reflection of the all-pervasive hyperinflation, and perhaps people thought that 10 was no longer a significantly grand number.</p>\n<p>In any case, I have scored 100 points. Hundreds.</p>\n<p>Allison</p>\n","excerpt":"<div class=\"full\"><img src=\"http://wrightonthebutton.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greenshot_mailbox.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-full\" /></div><p dir='auto'>Thanks to the Post to Email challenge issued by Wordpress, I now have only one unread message in my e-mail folder.

As the teacher looked down at her book, or turned to use the blackboard, a student might tap the person ahead and hand the paper up, or slide it carefully onto the desk at the left. At last the paper reached its intended recipient, whose name was block printed on one of the exposed sides. Her task was to open it, near the front of the classroom, without attracting the notice of the teacher. The message had to reach her during class, or she would pass into the halls and on to her next class without the urgent information in the note.</p>\n<p>By ninth grade, I regularly carried messages (usually just verbal) from a friend in my gym class, to her boyfriend in my English class. When we went on high school or scouting field trips, we were given regular hourly intervals at which each meandering group would \"meet back\" with the rest at a common point to allow the group leaders to count heads. If we went out from home and were late returning, our parents worried and called around to our friends' homes to find out where we were last spotted. (We were always scolded for not calling in on these occasions, as well.)</p>\n<p>Now, all of these things are handled using cell phones which can text, tweet, or email, in addition to just outright calling another person, to make sure no important communication is missed. We indeed live in interesting times.</p>\n<p>Now, in fact, electronic communication is so pervasive that we are seeking ways to limit it. Folks barely look up from their handheld devices as they cross a street, email boxes are full of \"spam\"/electronic junk mail, and we are rudely interrupted by phones ringing (and subsequent personal conversations) in restaurants, elevators, and other public places. Phones light up at the movies, distracting other theater goers, as an impatient recipient reads a text message that just can't wait. Television commercials warn against the serous dangers of texting while driving.</p>\n<p>Today, I read that Apple has received a patent to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"ipod limits\" href=\"http://myscienceacademy.org/2012/09/17/apple-granted-patent-to-disable-iphone-recordings-near-government-buildings-or-political-events/\">restrict iPhone recordings near government buildings and political events</a>. There is an outcry over this limitation of a freedom that, fifty years ago, was pure science fiction. So many benefits, so many issues.</p>\n<p>When I first had email, I rushed home to check my \"mailbox\" every night. Ten years later, I was so battered by the constant barrage of emails at work, and demands for immediate responses, that some nights I didn't even turn my personal computer on. Now I have a phone with texting and IM-ing, a laptop with email (three addresses for different purposes, neatly sorted by Outlook), Skype, Facebook and LinkedIn on both these devices and my Kindle Fire, and the ability to create and email a blog post from anywhere any time.</p>\n<p>These are all wonderful conveniences, but sometimes I just need to unplug. For the last five or six days I've been travelling. I popped into my email and Facebook twice to \"keep up,\" and if a family member had needed to reach me, I had a cell phone. I didn't feel the immediate need to use another device or program. Of course, during that time I neglected my blog, but it was sort of restful.</p>\n<p>I don't Tweet, Facebook, or text my every move (I don't care for it when other people do this, so I won't burden them either.) I don't post my opinions on Facebook (after all this is meant as <em>social media -</em>and weren't we taught not to discuss religion or politics socially?) I have my blog for my random thoughts and opinions (which I post to a separate Facebook page for those who care.) I truly appreciate my friends and followers, and will try to get caught up this week - but I unapologetically enjoyed my e-vacation.</p>\n<p>So, in the event that I'm somewhere away from home, perhaps on a prolonged trip, and I have an urgent need to communicate something on my blog, it will be wonderful that I have that ability from all of my electronic devices through email. I'm giving that a try for the first time with this post, including using some “shortcodes” – for example to tag it. However, just because I <em>can</em> do something with one of these marvelous devices doesn't mean that I necessarily should, or will.</p>\n<p>Time will tell how useful some of these new tech advances will be for me, but who knows? These are, after all, very interesting times.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>\n<p><em>This post was written in response to the the WordPress <strong>Weekly Writing Challenge: Mail It In</strong>.

It was a very happy time for us and her addition to our family added to that joy tremendously.  Beatrice was a very special gift because she was so much more than just a dog.  She was full of light and happiness that you could truly see when she pranced into a room.  Bea's heart and her funny quirks inspired me to write this blog.  I called her my Sweet-Bea.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3129\" title=\"628x471\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"419\" /></a></p>\n<p>When we first got Bea, the intention was to show her.  Her lineage was quite impressive and her potential as a show dog was thought to be endless.  Unfortunately for Bea's career, her heart melted ours and the thought of her being on the road at shows, away from us, was too much to bear.  Beatrice was our little lap dog and her place was with us, at home.  Still, the demand for Bea's puppies was high and we had planned to breed her.  In the upcoming months she was to be bred to Baker (a.k.a \"Nautilus Boston Baked Beans\" a US and Canadian champion) with whom the puppies would have been remarkable.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, on our way back to San Francisco after a great summer vacation on the east coast, Beatrice lost her life due to the negligence of United Airlines.  I'm writing this with my anger aside, in the hopes that someone looking for advice will read this and not make the mistake of trusting United with their pets as we did.</p>\n<p>Beatrice had a perfect health record.  She received a full examination and a health certificate four days before the flight, as is required by the Pet Safe program. This program is United's branded on-board pet safety program. In addition to Pet Safe's stringent requirements, we took every extra precaution we could think of.  Both the dog's kennels were labeled front to back with emergency numbers, flight information and warnings.  Their kennels were purchased specifically for the measurements and design specified by Pet Safe.  We purchased special water bowls which we filled with ice to ensure that the water wouldn't spill and that it would last longer. We drove the six hours to New York City from our house in Northern New York State, so the dogs wouldn't have to make a connecting flight.  We paid United Airlines $1800.00, in addition to our plane tickets, to ensure the safety of our pets. Albert and Bea were very prepared travelers.</p>\n<p>When we arrived in San Francisco to pick up our dogs we drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hanger were told simply, \"one of them is dead\" by the emotionless worker who seemed more interested in his text messages.  It took thirty minutes for a supervisor to come to tell us, \"it was the two year old.\"  Subsequently we requested that our dog be returned to us and were told that she had been delivered to a local vet for an autopsy. Whatever thread of trust remained between us and United broke and we then insisted that she be returned to us for our own autopsy by our trusted veterinarian, Shann Ikezawa, DVM from Bishop Ranch Veterinary Center. Over the next two hours the supervisor's lie unraveled as it became clear that Bea was right behind a closed door the whole time and he had been discussing how to handle the potential liability with his boss who had left and sticking to the divert and stall tactic that they had been taught. Eventually Bea was returned and we drove her to the vet at midnight.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3134\" title=\"35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>William Spangler DVM, PhD performed Beatrice's necropsy (a dog autopsy).  From the findings, it is Dr. Spangler's opinion that Beatrice's death was from  heatstroke.  Our little Beatrice died in pain, scared and alone.  Dr. Spangler also said that \"in my experience it is not unusual for a single dog in airline transit to be affected while other dogs of the same breed survive the trip apparently unscathed.\"</p>\n<p>It will be two weeks since Beatrice was killed by United Airlines and since then United has refused to give us any information about what happened to our beloved little Bea other then, \"our internal investigation does not show any irregularities, as evidenced by the fact that your companion dog and other animals on board did not suffer the same fate\".  I'm not sure why the fact that the other dogs were not killed clears United Airlines but, they seem to think it does.</p>\n<p>They had nothing to say about the fact that the plane had been turned off  (for at least fifteen minutes each time) twice before take-off in Newark, nor did they have anything to say when I requested information about her placement in the plane or about baggage being packed around her.  United Airlines additionally called our veterinarian and fabricated a story about having an email from me, authorizing them to obtain the necropsy results. This, after I specifically told them that we would release the results to them at our discretion.</p>\n<p>Aside from being completely emotionally distraught over the loss of our little Bea, I am so saddened by the complete lack of competence,  honesty and compassion that United has shown.  I am not writing this to start a lawsuit or to get anyone to stop flying United.  I am writing this to help make people aware that airlines are incapable of ensuring the safety of our pets.  All it takes is for one employee to not follow the proper procedure and then like me, your dog is dead.</p>\n<p>I can't say exactly what happened to Beatrice on the plane two weeks ago.  If United had been able to be honest, it would have helped us to find closure.  All I know is what the necropsy told us, Beatrice died from heatstroke.  It is said to be an agonizing death.</p>\n<p>Beatrice should have been happy, healthy and spoiled with us for years and years to come.</p>\n<p>Please don't make the mistake I made that cost our dog her life.  Please, don't trust that an airline will truly care and provide safety to your beloved pet. At some point in the two hours that Bea was in the care of United Airlines before she died, someone made a mistake and because of that, our loving, happy sweet Bea is no longer in our lives.</p>\n<p>I will miss her forever.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3138\" title=\"Photo on 2011-06-30 at 19.14 #4\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thank you for supporting beamakesthree over the past few years, I greatly appreciate it and have really enjoyed everyone's comments.

This continues to be the case even as I shift to a new role, and now I wonder how Bhutan’s emerging middle class will aspire to consume.</p>\n<p>At a personal level, I try to be a conscious consumer. I am vegetarian because I know of the exponentially greater impacts of meat in terms of water and energy use. I weigh my purchases carefully, buying second-hand when I can and especially choosing quality and durability over quantity. I reuse when possible and then recycle to the point where it annoys most people.</p>\n<p>In my work over the past few years, one theme that has constantly come up is the role that geography and economic development play in sustainable consumption. With 7 billion people on the planet and an inevitable trajectory towards 9 billion, we can no longer be gluttons of consumption in feigned ignorance of the need to allocate resources fairly across the globe. Between now and 2030, 70 million people will join the middle class each year, moving out from under the rock of poverty and into the sunshine of consumption. With this will come increased demand for goods and services associated with a new middle class: mobile phones, washing machines, televisions, cars...</p>\n<p>We checked into our Druk Air flight to Bhutan with an embarrassing 150kg of checked luggage, all too aware of the hypocrisy of being conscious consumers with so much stuff. I brought three cameras, two suits, one bicycle and a lot of painfully selected outdoor clothing and camping equipment. The cognitive dissonance (and excess luggage fees) made us pack carefully, but still the supplies for a year in Bhutan added up.</p>\n<p>In Europe we were conspicuous with the amount of luggage we had, but upon landing at Bhutan’s international airport in Paro, we were quite surprised to find ourselves in good company. As the tourists picked their bags off and the Bhutanese gravitated in<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bhutanchronicles.com/2012/09/18/conscious-consumption-in-bhutan/rtk_0134/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-340\"><img class=\" wp-image-340 alignright\" title=\"Televisions\" src=\"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/v2/placeholder.gif\" original=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0134.jpg?w=450\" alt=\"More than half the pieces on the belt were giant LCD TVs\" width=\"288\" height=\"192\" /></a>to small clusters, the small airport’s only luggage carousel started filling up with boxes. Large and rectangular, box after box lay flat on the belt, their corners hanging over as they navigated the single u-turn on the belt in front of us, and finally I could read the magic letters: LCD. Fully half of the pieces on the carousel were 40 inch flat screen televisions, each soon to channel a nearly infinite amount of full-colour HD aspirations to Bhutan’s new middle class.</p>\n<p>Nearly every individual in this country grew up in an austerity that we cannot even imagine. No electricity, no running water, no refrigeration, no shoes, and of course no radio, television or internet. This was the norm for most of the country 30 years ago. While at a neighbour’s last night, we heard stories how our host, an accomplished artist who has traveled extensively to the United States over the past dozen years, remembers his first pair of Indian shoes with rubber soles which he only acquired as a grown man. Over dinner we were told of his encounter with an Amish community in Tennessee: He simply could not comprehend how a community surrounded by the 21st century would choose to ignore the benefits of light, electricity and the internal combustion engine.</p>\n<p>In turn, I try to understand our host’s antipathy for this conceit of the Amish, (and hide my own appreciation for their austerity). The fact that I haven’t owned a television in a dozen years and make conscious decisions to limit my consumption would probably not make sense to most of my fellow Americans; it would possibly make even less sense to someone in Bhutan who grew up without so many things we take for granted.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bhutanchronicles.com/2012/09/18/conscious-consumption-in-bhutan/rtk_0141/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-339\"><img class=\" wp-image-339 alignleft\" title=\"Baggage\" src=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0141.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0141.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"Arriving in Paro with a lot of baggage!\" width=\"315\" height=\"210\" /></a>After nearly five years exploring so many facets of consumption with business leaders and experts from around the world, everything that I have learned has been challenged within minutes of arriving into my new home country.

When kids are young and looking forward to a hot new toy, they sometimes try to approximate its presence in their lives by creating an <em>ersatz</em> model to take the place of the real thing until they can actually touch, hold, and use the real thing. Strangely, this is happening with increasing frequency to the iPhone. The tech world is so hungry for <em>anything</em> iPhone that they will contract graphic designers to create 3D models of the new gadgets, and even go so far as to build full physical models.</p>\n<p>The noise is deafening.</p>\n<p>Post after post featuring blurry component photos hits the interwebs, and the tech press gobbles them up like bacon-stuffed donuts. Most folks don't follow tech blogs, don't really have a pressing desire to know the internal layout of new gadgets, feel no need to really seek this stuff out. They read what falls in their lap and, usually, are better and more sane because of it.</p>\n<p>Then the device hits, and it elicits \"yawns\" from the peanut gallery because they've already seen it all. They make sweeping (often literally global) statements about the reception of the product, about the excitement it's generated, etc. Their actions are, again, childish, just like the kid whose favorite team gets eliminated from the playoffs really early and starts claiming that no one likes [<em>insert sport here</em>] anymore, anyway.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, they're embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Who wouldn't be? Their phones are either knock-offs or faked. The real deal is just that, and consumers know the difference. Companies will try to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Not on the list: &quot;Runs the Best Mobile OS on the Market (iOS)&quot; (nope), &quot;Works with the App Store&quot; (nada), or &quot;Hasn't Shixpped Yet&quot; (check!)\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/1/3212328/lenovo-thinkpad-tablet-2-features-specifications\" target=\"_blank\">illustrate</a> how their products \"stack up\" against Apple's iPad, or iPhone, or whatever, but it ultimately just makes them look, again, juvenile. I can make a checklist that makes me look like the best human being ever compared to random people on the street. I could create a checklist of the features of a raw, uncooked potato, and compare it to all the features of a slice of deep-dish Chicago pizza, but comparing those two things would make no sense. \"Grows in the ground\", \"Has eyes\", \"Will sprout if placed in water\" are all \"features\" of the potato that the pizza doesn't have, but who really cares? I'll take the pizza thankyouverymuch.</p>\n<p>Which leads me back to my point. The leaked specs, the feature parity, the checklists, etc. are all meaningless in the face of true user experience and the whole package.</p>\n<p>A guy I know had his iPhone run over by a car. It was absolutely destroyed, which was sad for him. He was contemplating purchasing a replacement, but decided to wait it out until his contract was up for renewal so he could purchase a new iPhone 4S. In the meantime, someone gave him a Motorola Droid RAZR (or whatever it's called...these things have the weirdest names). He ditched the Droid in favor of an iPhone 3G. You read that right. He disliked the Droid user experience so much that he went with a molasses-slow (comparatively) phone, simply because the overall user experience was so superior. When you're on the losing team, shouting really loudly and making a lot of noise is still fun, sure, but it doesn't win you ball games. Just ask Cubs fans.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it's clear that people are jazzed about the iPhone 5, and all these \"yawn\" reactions are just the tech news equivalent of Cubs fans getting uppity. People will choose good design and a fluid, beautiful user experience over checklists and noise.</p>\n<p>As they say, it doesn't take a genius.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p dir='auto'>There's something strange that's been happening in the world of tech as hotly anticipated products (primarily of the Apple variety) near launch: the world finds &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">600 more words, 28 comments, 43 likes, 1 link</p>","post_id":525,"guid":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525","permalink":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/embarrassed/","blog_id":"8729525","blog":"Musings of a Forgetful Panda","blogurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348258079,"comment_count":"28","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"1h","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=fb7974ab18","unlikeurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=fb7974ab18","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=8729525&amp;_wpnonce=e7aa917ee6","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=8729525&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=e7aa917ee6","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":18,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://en.wordpress.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpentimento.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Fjackstaff41.jpg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"tim","author_avatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f23dce32a50bee06a3d8bebd698f5c0e?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Flogo%2Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"Paul Grist: Serious Funny Books","content":"<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2798\" title=\"Let's put our bacon on the table.

Are there people out there who think that the only thing that stopped Bill Watterson being successful was that he didn't draw a realistic tiger? I just try to generate a readability, an immediacy, something that can be recognized and identified with.\"</p>\n<p>After a childhood following artists such as Mike Noble, Frank Bellamy and Gerry Haylock, Grist broke into comics via the UK's small-press scene. His first effort, Short Stories, came to the attention of DC Thomson's girls' comics group, and the publisher offered him work within a week – a contrast to his failure to catch the eye of Marvel and 2000AD, which were proving to be tougher nuts.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps the lesson is that it's a lot easier to get into those comics that not many other people are aiming for. DC Thompson were great and kept me busy for a couple of years, working primarily on Nikki. I did short humour strips, quiz illustrations, and drew the cover strip for a year or so.\"</p>\n<p>A higher profile arrived in 1989 when Grist illustrated Grant Morrison's St. Swithin's Day, originally for Trident and later reprinted by Oni Press. Morrison's deliberately provocative mix of youthful unrest and anti-Thatcherite bile grabbed some headlines, but at least as much impact comes from the ink-heavy art and its unnerving high contrast. Grist's cartooning does exactly what McCloud describes, turning the troubled protagonist into an ambiguous, queasy mirror.</p>\n<p><strong>LIVING IN EDEN</strong><br />\nKane, the self-published story of New Eden's 39th Precinct and its officers, is where everything clicked. A long-form police procedural, with constant flashbacks to trip up the unwary and sub-plots that looked all set to tumble on forever, the shadowy past of Detective Kane was a sprawling canvas for Grist's imagination to work with.</p>\n<p>When it appeared in 1993, the comparisons were with David Lapham's Stray Bullets and Frank Miller's Sin City - Grist affectionately ribbed Miller's stories several times as he went along - but Kane was a chillier, more humane, and more effective strip. And for readers who found that New Eden's moustachioed SWAT team leader and his taste for excessive violence rang a bell, the strongest influence was clearly from another medium altogether.</p>\n<p>\"Hill Street Blues is very much the template for Kane: multiple storylines with a wide-ranging cast, and a mix of drama and comedy,\" agrees Grist. \"I loved doing Kane. I think in general if you're not working on your favourite comic then you're probably doing it wrong, and it certainly helped get me noticed within the industry.\"</p>\n<p>Grist's storytelling efforts in Kane were certainly noticeable, since he worked the page hard. One issue is told from a fixed vantage point on the rear seat of a patrol car; another makes do without speech or captions. A gangster speaks in a style on loan from Marlon Brando's Don Corleone, via phonetic speech balloons to be unpicked at leisure; Kane himself often says hardly anything. Officer Kate Felix, ever the voice of reason, gets one of the great stand-alone issues of any comic, a childhood incident and present-day crisis running in parallel.</p>\n<p>\"I just try to make the page visually interesting,\" comments Grist. \"Comics are a visual medium, so when people just put one square panel after another, I think they're really not using the medium to its full potential. To me that seems like dancing but not moving your feet.\"</p>\n<p>Kane was the definition of a cult hit, with vocal champions but not a huge readership. The book's narrative became extended by publication delays and threatened to grind to a halt, and some felt that the flashback structure was too hard to follow. \"Kane was very popular with the people who liked it, but sadly there weren't that many of them,\" says Grist looking back. \"Ultimately it just wasn't selling enough for me to be able to continue.\"</p>\n<p><strong>THE PAST IS NEVER DEAD</strong><br />\nAs Kane showed signs of fatigue, Grist responded with Jack Staff, originally aiming to attract readers and then draw them over to Kane. Hence a change of tack: from an American cop to a British superhero. But the tone was recognisably from the same pen.</p>\n<p>\"I tend to see my comics as being a mix of the sombre and the humorous,\" explains Grist. \"Serious funny books. Or funny serious books. Jack Staff is all about cause and effect, rather than nostalgia, but it's also about ageing and death. Jack Staff is someone who is alive forever; Becky Burdock, vampire girl reporter, is dead forever. And together they're facing the End of Everything. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. You can still have a bit of fun along the road.\"</p>\n<p>If Kane was Americana, then Jack Staff is British to the core, loosely formatted in the style of past British action weeklies and seasoned with business from the UK's collective memory. A flashback to 1940 allows for a walk-on by the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, while the ambiguously spectral Helen Morgan addresses the reader from limbo and views the world through the Play School windows.</p>\n<p>\"I just throw in things that amuse me, really,\" comments her creator. \"None of the in-jokes or references to old British comic characters are important in terms of the story, it's just an extra layer for British readers of a certain age. I hope the story holds up in and of itself, and the fact that readers elsewhere can get it gives me some confidence that it does.\"</p>\n<p>The Americans at Image Comics got it, and picked up the book as a continuing series, leading not only to greater visibility for the strip, but also to a transition into colour.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, colour transforms the effect of Grist's art. The black-and-white Jack Staff is a contemplative, moody strip, sometimes given to introspection. The Image version is a full-colour Hellzapoppin', in which anything goes, the layouts fizz, and the next figure around the corner may be demon, ghoul or giant talking goldfish.</p>\n<p>\"Eric Stephenson contacted me out of the blue and asked if I had ever thought about publishing Jack Staff at Image, to which the only honest answer was no. It  was only when they said that they wanted to publish it as a full-colour comic that it made sense to do it, since that gave me an opportunity to do something that I couldn't do with my own resources. Image also allows me to have everything in print at the same time, which as a self-publisher was something that was proving a bit of a juggling act.\"</p>\n<p>Grist had always wanted to include colour in Jack Staff: \"After all, it's a superhero comic, and superhero comics are always in colour. I like to think of the original series as being a colour comic with a lot of black-and-white pages. But I do still find myself in the mindset of drawing black-and-white pages which are then coloured in. I don't think a black-and-white page is simply a colour page without colour. That's a common mistake in comics, I think.\"</p>\n<p><strong>A PAPER MEDIUM</strong><br />\n\"In 1993 when I started doing Kane there were two big distributors plus several smaller ones, and there were less people actively making comics, so it was a bit easier to get noticed,\" says Grist. \"Now there is a single distributor which has tightened up a lot on what it will distribute, and which expects bar codes and all sorts of other professional malarkey that wasn't asked for in my day. I'm not saying it is a bad thing that Diamond expects to approve the comics that they solicit for, but it makes it just a bit more difficult to get a new comic out there.\"</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the rise of the internet means it has become easier to get work seen by potential readers - whether or not the work is any good, or profitable. But fittingly for an artist with a taste for wrangling the fixed dimensions of a paper page, Grist feels no great urge to decamp onto the internet or create a web comic.</p>\n<p>\"As far as I'm concerned, comics are a paper medium,\" he says. \"This may well be an age thing. I don't find reading comics on screen to be that interesting, so web comics are not something that I'm really planning on exploring in the near future. I did serialise a comic I published, The Eternal Conflicts of the Cosmic Warrior, in a blog, but that was more a case of putting a paper comic on-screen than actually doing a comic for the web.</p>\n<p>\"After years as an active self-publisher, I've now been published by Image for longer than I spent putting out my own books, so I’m really out of the loop as far as self-publishing goes nowadays. But one of the encouraging things about going to comic shows around the UK is that there are new, young people putting out their own comics. Twenty years ago you'd go to the London Convention and the small-press section would be in a corridor leading through to the main hall. Now they've become a main event in their own right. There's a lot of creativity out there, which is very encouraging to see.\"</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2810\" title=\"In the mouth of madness.

You can go anywhere in the world and find coffee and the culture that surrounds it.”</p>\n<p>I never for one moment doubted that statement. Coffee was something so personal to me, something that was more than just a warm cup; but rather an experience, emotional and physical, that I craved whether or not it was the caffeine driving it.</p>\n<p>My friends at home were jealous when I told them I was moving to Seattle. I saw the barista faces of my friends long for the opportunity to be surrounded by so much good coffee. While I refrained from telling them just how many Starbucks there were in the city, I did share in their excitement and look forward to experiencing the coffee vibe of this city for myself.</p>\n<p>Today when I woke up I knew that it was time to go to a coffee shop, alone, and see for myself what it felt like here. I know that buying coffee isn’t going to be something I can do on a regular basis, given the absurd price for a cup of joe in this city, but I was feeling lonely and I knew that something familiar would help me feel more at home in this city.</p>\n<p>What would make a barista feel more at home than a coffee shop?</p>\n<p>I opted for a coffee shop close to my aunt’s store called Zoka. As I walked through the large entrance I admired the beautiful woodwork and breathed in the familiar scent of coffee beans.  I noticed that the store was filled with other Seattle natives typing away on their computers or visiting with friends and smiled – this was a picture I was used to.</p>\n<p>When I stepped up to the counter and looked at their menu I refrained from blurting out “You do Pour Over’s too? We’re the only shop in Boise that does that!” though I’m sure my friendly barista would have smiled and not thought I was too weird because of it.</p>\n<p>I ordered my usual and scoped out a spot by the window where I could observe the people who came through the door. Young and old, students and couples, hippies and hipsters all walked through the door and looked like they belonged here. I wondered if I looked like I was supposed to be there too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-201\" title=\"IMG_3690\" src=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"397\" /></a></p>\n<p>My barista poured stunning latte art and I immediately sent a picture to my co-assistant manager back home, knowing he’d appreciate it. I felt another pang of loneliness knowing nobody was here to share this moment with me. But when I complimented my barista on her excellent pouring she smiled and we exchanged a few friendly words before I sat down to write.</p>\n<p>I may not know anyone in this town yet, but I feel comfortable with one of the biggest parts of the culture: coffee. Maybe I haven’t made any friends, but the friendly smiles of others in the coffee shop reassure me that I’ve learned the language here – it’s only a matter of time before I get to speak it with someone.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-202\" title=\"IMG_3692\" src=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zokacoffee.com/\">Zoka Coffee</a></strong></p>\n<p>2901 NE Blakeley Street<br />\nSeattle, WA 98105<br />\n206.527.0990<br />\nMon-Fri: 6am to 9pm<br />\nSat-Sun: 7am to 9pm</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>When I first started working at the District Coffee Shop, my boss told me “Coffee is a universal language.

It took no convincing for me to plan this for my students, realizing the impact it could have on their world perspectives. It is so challenging for students to grasp this immense planet and consider that they might \"make a mark\" on it!</p>\n<p>The story, if you are not familiar, is of a girl named Vashti who believes she cannot draw.  After being instructed to simply make a mark on the paper and sign it, she discovers that her teacher truly values that mark and Vashti challenges herself to create even more kinds of dots.</p>\n<p>On the Morning Message I told them to look for a piece of paper on their desks.  I had placed different colored dots in different locations on the paper and instructed the students to simply \"see where the dot takes you!\" So much interesting artwork resulted from the simple prompt.<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg\"><br />\n<img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"IMG_0541\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>                                  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"IMG_0542\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>After reading the book, we began to build the idea of the dot metaphor.  What does it mean to make your mark on the world? On our class? On our school? The idea was still a bit fuzzy to them, so we wrote about our talents, our smarts, (we have been exploring the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Intelligence\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple Intelligences</a>) and considered how these talents might help others around us.</p>\n<p>Then, we Skyped with another 3rd grade class at an international school in Berlin, Germany.  Lining up the time was tricky, since there was a 6 hour time difference. However, Ms. Victor (@victortweets) hosts a book club after school, so our group of 35 3rd graders got to talk to her 5 students attending the club that day!  I loved the dot activity they shared- their artwork displayed original dots each student created, representing different positive \"marks\" they wanted to make on the world...happiness, caring...etc.  This really helped my students to begin to generalize the idea of making your \"mark\".</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-540 aligncenter\" title=\"IMG_0532\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p> Finally, we extended this activity to relate to our classroom behavior by considering: What mark do we want to make on our classroom? Together we created a list of qualities we hoped our classmates saw in each other.  Our mission then was to create abstract artwork showing the mark we wish to make on our class community, a \"dot\" to represent the quality they hope their classmates see within. Last week we learned about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learningtogive.org/lessons/unit72/lesson3.html\">Random Acts of Kindness</a>, and I think connecting these random \"marks\" made will help them to understand even more, the power of their mark.</p>\n<p>They were so excited about the idea of \"connecting the dots\" between New Hampshire and Germany, and I could read amazement and disbelief on their faces that we were actually talking to other kids so far away...but seemingly so close. I look forward to capitalizing on the power of Skype to continue expanding the students' worlds. While creating a dot to represent personal qualities is an extremely abstract thought, I knew that many students understood when they began writing and sharing their explanations of the art work.  Students considered size, color, placement, pattern etc. with regards to the represented quality.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-541 alignleft\" title=\"IMG_0539\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>                     <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-542 alignright\" title=\"IMG_0540\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Truly an experience with literal, metaphorical, personal, and global components.  Truly the way learning comes alive for learners.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related Posts</h6>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Day 2 in Review at #BLC12: Innovation is Questioning in Action\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/day-2-in-review-at-blc12-innovation-is-action-answering-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">Day 2 in Review at BLC '12</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"#BLC12- Favorites from Day One: Choice and Assessment!\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/blc12-favorites-from-day-one-choice-and-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\">BLC '12: Favorites from Day One...</a></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://childrensbooksheal.com/2012/08/27/international-dot-day-sept-15-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">International Dot Day - Sept. 15, 2012</a> (childrensbooksheal.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelamaiers.com/2012/09/promoting-student-engagement-make-your-mark.html\" target=\"_blank\">Promoting Student Engagement ~ Make Your Mark</a> (angelamaiers.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelamaiers.com/2012/09/skype-in-the-classroom-connecting-dots-between-schools-students-and-communities.html\" target=\"_blank\">Skype In the Classroom - Connecting Dots between Schools, Students and Communities</a> (angelamaiers.com)</li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://wordpress.com/imgpress?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peterhreynolds.com%2Fdot%2FsmDot.jpg&resize=84,84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>Monday was my first experience Skyping my class around the world!

I really need to pick up a smaller icing tip and to work on keeping a steady hand. The problem with these cutters are that they are VERY large (about 6inches), so that's a lot of surface area to outline and flood at an even pressure, with a steady hand. I guess I'll just have to keep practicing!</p>\n<p>As for the royal icing recipe, I think I finally found the right ratios. Here's what I went with, which is basically <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sweetsugarbelle.com/blog/2011/04/royal-icing-101-or-all-roads-lead-to-rome/\">Sweet Sugarbelle's</a> recipe divided by four (thank you to the wonderful Heather, a.k.a. my calculator):</p>\n<p><strong>Royal Icing:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 lb of confectioner's sugar</li>\n<li>3 tbsp meringue powder</li>\n<li>1 tbsp vanilla</li>\n<li>6 tbsp water</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Sift together dry ingredients in your mixer</li>\n<li>Add vanilla and water together and then slowly add to dry ingredients while mixing</li>\n<li>Mix at medium-high speed until fluffy (bald eagle) peaks form, about 7-10 minutes total</li>\n<li>Adjust consistency for piping or flood icing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This time around, I had fewer air bubbles, but they still bothered me. Overall, though, I was quite pleased with the consistency of the icing.</p>\n<p>I also played around with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Leaves-Acorns-9-Piece-Aluminum/dp/B00004WHQJ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348353807&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wilton+acorn+cookie+cutter\">these new cutters</a>, which I bought with the hopes of making them for my family's Thanksgiving table. I was QUITE pleased with how these turned out.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1973.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1973.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-327\" title=\"Leaves\" src=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1973.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1973.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" /></a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1982.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1982.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-331\" title=\"Leaves and acorns\" src=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1982.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1982.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you look closely, you'll notice that these did not get outlined and filled. Instead, I used Sweet Sugarbelle's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sweetsugarbelle.com/blog/2012/03/consistency-is-key-twenty-second-icing-and-more/\">20 second icing</a> consistency, which is somewhere in between piping and flood. This allows you to skip the outline without having your icing slide off the cookie. I'm thinking that it might make more sense to try that method with the science lab cookies next time around.</p>\n<p>Off to go brush my teeth after all those cookies... ; )</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1980.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1973.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://smallworldsupperclub.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1982.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>So, you may recall that I am honing my sugar cookie baking and decorating.

Ironically, when I was in the thick of being a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.paulaknight.co.uk/\">children's illustrator</a>, I didn't keep sketchbooks - the last thing I needed in my spare time was to be drawing. I had to rest my overstretched tendons and tunnels (I had recurring RSI). In recent years I've started to carry one around with me again. I've also included some pages from other sketchbooks - I have them of varying sizes from a tiny one that fits in my purse to an A4 book at home in which I do comics workings-out.</p>\n<p>I don't often attempt to do finished drawings in them - they're more for practising looking, and planning (comics). I like to draw in cafes, on journeys, on beaches, and in waiting rooms etc. In these situations, people are in varying degrees of motion, which means fast drawing is required to get any sense of form. I like that challenge, and the results are very gestural lines - mere essence of movement or character.</p>\n<p>My reasons for sketching are varied, and include: taking the opportunity to practise drawing when I'm not doing anything else; an attempt to be 'in the moment' and record it for posterity; on occasion, to escape from the moment or thoughts, or from boredom; note-taking at talks; and I also sketch in the wee hours when I can't sleep - this tends to be when comics idea emerge. They can seem very urgent and important in a dozy half-slumber but often appear pretty rubbish later in the day.

I had never expected that I would travel so far. None of it felt real. I visited the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, and the Louvre. Then I visited the place I most wanted to see: Jim Morrison's grave in Père LaChaise cemetery. His music and poetry had helped me through my turbulent high school years. His image had hung on my bedroom wall. I had worn a button with his photo on my black leather jacket. On the vacant building across from my high school, I had spray painted the same words that I had doodled all over my school notebooks: <em>Jim Morrison Lives</em>. I had self-medicated with whatever I could find (which, thankfully, wasn't much in those days) and had written stream of consciousness poetry while listening to <em>An American Prayer</em>. Scarcely two years had passed since then, and yet a lot had changed in my life. Much of my rage had dissipated, but scars remained.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8801.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8801.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-198\" title=\"JM8801\" src=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8801.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm8801.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"555\" height=\"576\" /></a></p>\n<p>A handful of people were gathered around the grave. Someone had scrawled a poem and left a rose in an empty wine bottle on the battered slab that passed for his tombstone. A young man slouched on the next grave over. He clutched a dog-eared paperback and his face was contorted with angst. I stood for a few moments, my head bowed. Disappointed in myself for feeling numb, for forgetting to bring a flower, at least.

I had recently begun to write with the intent of being published. I wanted to visit Jim Morrison's grave again, even though I'd long since realized that a lot of his poetry was nothing more than random, incoherent scrawlings from his notebooks that his estate had published in order to milk as much money as possible out of his legacy. It had been years since I'd listened to a Doors album. Even so, he was the first person who sparked in me the urge to write. Because of him, I had learned that it was possible to push the boundaries of creativity and revel in strangeness.</p>\n<p>The battered old tombstone had been replaced, and there was an epitaph written in Greek “ΚΑΤΑ ΤΟΝ ΔΑΙΜΟΝΑ ΕΑΥΤΟΥ”, which means “true to his self”. Despite the bitterly cold day, there were about a dozen people gathered around. I placed my wilted rose on the frozen earth, touched the tombstone, and whispered, “Thank you.” When I looked up, I saw wistful smiles.</p>\n<p>(this photo was taken with a disposable camera)<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm00.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm00.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-200\" title=\"JM00\" src=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm00.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm00.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"836\" /></a></p>\n<p>In March of 2010, I visited Père LaChaise once more. This time it was in search of the Countess de Castiglione, who is the subject of a novel that I've been writing off and on for years. After I had found her, I meandered the immense labyrinth until I spotted a small crowd gathered around a metal fence. They all seemed so young, but then I realized that I was their age when I made my first pilgrimage. The tombstone was unchanged, but it could now only be viewed from afar.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1003.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1003.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-202\" title=\"JM1003\" src=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1003.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1003.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\" /></a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1001.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1001.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-201\" title=\"JM1001\" src=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1001.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://julieriso.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/jm1001.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"458\" /></a></p>\n<p>I reflected on my previous visits and how I had changed since then.

Google \"mosaic house numbers\" and you'll see what I mean. No disrespect to the artistry involved (or to the very talented professional mosaicists), but mosaic art - especially naïve mosaic art - more often than not lacks elegance. It can be fun, cute, colourful and cheerful, but rarely classy these days. This ain't Pompeii.</p>\n<p>Despite my attitude, I bought a sizeable amount of ceramic tile to revitalize my mother-in-law's living room tables. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to use the tiles without sawing into the table tops (while she's away), and I'm not so disrespectful a daughter-in-law as to disfigure her dated but quality wood furniture in my clumsy efforts to redecorate. So I abandoned the living room table project.</p>\n<p>But that left me with tesserae (i.e., tiles).</p>\n<p>The one area of her house that has bothered me the most has been her front porch. Australia doesn't have a strong front porch culture like America does. We Americans love to sit on the front porch with a cold glass of something or other and talk about the neighbours. Not so much here. Aussies love their private backyards.</p>\n<p>My mother-in-law's front porch doesn't face anything but a row of hedges on either side of the driveway, so there wouldn't be much point for even an American to sit on it. And because of the hedges, it gets only scattered light.</p>\n<p>So it's been forever neglected.</p>\n<p>Here's the porch before the blue trim was painted beige. The front door is blue here, to the left of the umbrellas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_old2.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_old2.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-5546\" title=\"Porch_old2\" src=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_old2.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_old2.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"528\" height=\"703\" /></a></p>\n<p>A long and skinny porch, the other end housed only a rusted iron and wicker table that took up the entire width of the patio. An old birdcage from Tunisia sat on the glass table top, and a rusty white cabinet against a wall housed nothing. The trim is now beige.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_bare.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_bare.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-5548\" title=\"Porch_bare\" src=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_bare.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_bare.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"528\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p>My mission over the past six weeks (while my mother-in-law was away) was to renovate the heck out of this porch. And so began the mosaic challenge!</p>\n<p>A mosaic house number seemed like a good idea since her house is one of three in a cul-de-sac, numbered 29-C. It would help visitors and various delivery men identify the house, right?</p>\n<p>When I started the project, I soon realised that I had made a common beginner's error: <strong>failure to calculate</strong>. I had bought 1 cm x 1 cm tiles for a large piece of MDF, roughly 100 cm x 70 cm. That's 7000 tiles! (I hadn't bought that many.)</p>\n<p>So I had to reconsider my design plans and bought some 10 cm x 10 cm ceramic tiles from the mosaic supply store, as well as some cheap bathroom tiles from my local hardware store.</p>\n<p>Here's the final result:</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_headon.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_headon.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5549\" title=\"Calga_headon\" src=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_headon.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_headon.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"493\" /></a></p>\n<p>Clearly, I'm not a professional mosaicist. And I think this piece is still a little kitsch. I've done other mosaics since this one, and it's now my least favourite. But it has sentimental value as my first try, and it serves its original purpose: to better adorn a bare and uninviting porch. I've hung this piece to the left of the front door, now painted red.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_context2.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_context2.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5550\" title=\"Calga_context2\" src=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_context2.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_context2.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"883\" /></a></p>\n<p>Beneath the piece, I've positioned an old wood poolside table that had gone grey. I stained it the same charcoal colour used to stain the frame of the mosaic and I placed a plant on top whose leaves help to ground the green tile. The crisp white pot also echoes the two different-sized white bathroom tiles used generously in the design.</p>\n<p>Sometimes this mosaic makes me smile. It's reminiscent of the old subway mosaics in New York City (and even in Sydney).</p>\n<p>At other times, I think of redoing it.</p>\n<p>But for the moment, there's no other use for a mosaic that reads \"29-C Calga\" other than to hang it on this house. So here it stays.</p>\n<p><strong>Next up:</strong> The Mosaic Challenge: Bench Seat (sneak peek above)</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_old2.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/porch_bare.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_headon.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://humanbehaviorblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/calga_context2.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>Modern mosaics are kitsch.

We extracted the base resources (in this case, the various stuff needed to make plastic, and trees for paper), created the product (and used a bunch of oil), and shipped it over a great distance, only to be used once or never used and then put out on the street to be stored underground in landfills. Not to mention the land that goes to waste when you need to build a bigger landfill. All of this in the name of possibly making a few extra bucks.</p>\n<p>It wouldn't be as bad if the companies involved made a concerted effort to ensure the final product wasn't a complete waste. For example, if they just gave the trays / glasses to local bars or to second-hand stores, or maybe avoided creating mostly-useless and distinctly disposable plastic products in the first place, or made a concerted effort to recycle, repurpose, or create compostable products.</p>\n<p>It's all too symbolic of the times we live in, but there are things we can do. I recently read about a website called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.change.org/en-CA\">Change.org</a> which has had some success getting different restaurants to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/10/changeorg-petitions-restaurants_n_1871256.html\">adopt more environmentally friendly practices</a>. Perhaps some petitions are in order?</p>\n<p>What other ways can we encourage less wasteful practices? Beyond me finding it before it gets trashed, of course ;)</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1021.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1031.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1030.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1022-e1348255881852.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1027.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://curbfinds.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_1026.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>I went out this afternoon to try to get a trumpet I have fixed up.

Almost simultaneously, other news revealed the social networking giant is rolling out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/facebook-search-history/\">new features</a> that allow users to view and delete their search history. My husband and I had a brief discussion on the topic of privacy and data protection, and unlike most times, we found ourselves surprised to have very opposite points of view. So I decided to write about it, mostly to illustrate my opinion and hopefully start an interesting discussion.</p>\n<p>As a lawyer and a lover of liberty, my first reaction is to reject the idea of a facial recognition system altogether. Just imagine all the implications for the right to privacy of having a giant database out there with enough information to locate you, even in a crowd, anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>While this may sound like a promising tool for the prevention of terrorism and tracking down of criminals, results actually show otherwise. Indeed, it was reported that the Tampa Police Department stopped its use after the technology generated hundreds of false positives, but not a single arrest. That just means the technology isn’t good <em>enough </em>yet, though.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, facial recognition can be downright creepy. The other day while uploading an album from a recent museum visit, I was asked to identify the “people” in a photo, which were actually deteriorated statues from the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Another time, Facebook suggested a tag of my brother on a picture of me. <em>Ew.</em></p>\n<p>A bit more seriously, the relevant question here is what are the actual risks that users face? What exactly are we protecting here?</p>\n<p>Before addressing this question, a little history:</p>\n<p>In 1980, the OECD promoted guidelines for the protection of personal data. Accordingly, there are several principles that should be respected if handling personal data. They basically say that you should know when your data is being collected, what for, and that it should not be used for anything other than the stated purpose. Other principles cover security, disclosure, access and accountability.</p>\n<p>That sounds like poetry to my lawyer ears, but they were merely suggestions. So, how many states did actually implement these guidelines? Yes, you guessed right. <em>Zero</em>.</p>\n<p>Recently we’ve had more honest efforts, and as of 1998 every European country has its own data protection legislation in accordance with a European directive that was issued on the topic. As for the United States, it’s been more of a trial and error process. Despite the existence of some regulation there is an overall tendency to promote self-regulation among the incumbent entities, leaving behind a lot of loopholes. But how well does this self-regulation work?</p>\n<p>So far, in the case of social media, not bad. Besides the protection that the law grants, you can count on the services themselves for fine-tuning. Google’s social networking service G+ had its momentum when it announced that it would feature new privacy and sharing controls, which Facebook lacked and swiftly adopted in order to keep users from fleeing. Despite allegations of social network <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherbarger/2011/12/20/the-top-ten-social-media-lessons-of-2011-part-i/\">fatigue</a>, the market has proven itself capable of adapting to (some) user needs.</p>\n<p>So, going back to our question, what exactly are we protecting?</p>\n<p>Without going completely “conspiracy theorist” on you, one of the arguments most often used against facial recognition is the fear that it could lead to a “mass surveillance society”. Yoann argued at this point, validly, that it is not the government we are dealing with. It’s just Facebook. Right?</p>\n<p>Wrong. The thought of a mass surveillance state might seem like a far-fetched idea to you, but it’s actually <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Listening_to_you_at_last:_EU_plans_to_tap_cell_phones\">not</a>. </em>Indeed, we hear everywhere about scandals regarding different types of privacy-invasive acts such as tapped conversations, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/americans-may-have-to-wait-for-europe-for-better-data-protection-a-849372.html\">misrepresentations</a> about the use of tracking cookies (even when users expressly disabled them, Google still kept using them and gladly paid the fine that followed), the government officials using twitter to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/01/31/destroy-america-on-twitter-get-deported/\">track down supposed threats</a>, the police being allowed access to social media accounts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/no-warrant-required-judge-rules-police-can-subpoena-tweets-even-deleted-ones/\">without a warrant</a>, and access being granted to these accounts without even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.good.is/posts/zuckers-facebook-has-secretly-been-giving-user-info-to-cops/\">notifying the user</a>, just to mention a few.</p>\n<p>Again, my husband (acceptably) argues: if you don’t want something to be known, just don’t share it. But asking myself each and every time before hitting that “post” button “Could this content seem in any way incriminating?” is borderline psychopathic behavior.</p>\n<p>The ramifications don’t limit themselves to police activity, of course. Information obtained through social media can and has been used during the processing of insurance claims, the assessment of a candidate for a job (there are companies created exclusively for this purpose), not to mention the intrusive commercial applications of facial recognition systems, among many others.</p>\n<p>With recent Facebook updates it is easier to control how your data is shared with the public. However, there is still certain information that is <em>always</em> public (name, profile and cover pictures, network, gender, username and ID). The alternative Facebook offers you? To delete your account.</p>\n<p>Then another question arises: Who are Facebook’s <em>real </em>customers? Sure, they want to create a good product so that we can keep using it, the same way a farmer keeps feeding his cows so that they will stay alive and produce milk. This has been discussed before, many, many, times. Facebook wants you to keep providing information so that they can keep monetizing it and getting better at it. For the moment, most of their profit comes from advertisers, but who is to say it will be that way forever? Users certainly don’t have a say in whom Facebook can or can’t do business with.</p>\n<p>Yet the use of social media remains safe “enough” that most of us don’t even consider these issues. After all, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner concluded their report on Facebook with a positive note. However, that still means that your information could be revealed (according to Facebook's own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines/\">guidelines</a>) to public authorities in accordance with the law, which in certain cases does not grant much protection.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there may be a brighter side to the story. There are some software that include this feature such as Google’s Picasa and Apple’s iPhoto, for example, which allow users to organize their photo library by tagging recognized people on photos. This represents a practical advantage for the consumer, and in the future there will probably be many exciting and non-intrusive developments to this technology. Facebook themselves expressed that they would revisit facial recognition when they figure out how to keep the legislators happy (after all, they did invest millions acquiring a face recognition tech company this year).</p>\n<p>So, ultimately, by providing Facebook with a vast amount of information we are trusting that they will not use it for any purpose other than those annoying and increasingly accurate ads. Until a breach of that trust occurs, this matter and the minor incidents will continue to be overlooked.</p>\n","excerpt":"<div class=\"full\"><img src=\"http://thenewtechnologist.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-face-recognition.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-full\" /></div><p dir='auto'>By Erika Batista So today the news broke out that Facebook turned off their ill-famed facial recognition feature, otherwise known as “tag suggest”, in Europe.

Everyone knows 'fake' names and 'fake' accounts - my sister's dog has a Facebook account - so few believed that Facebook was going to bother enforcing it, except for obvious trolls and so forth. Now, however, that appears to be changing.</p>\n<p>Initially, I wondered if this was just a fake - the screenshot could easily have been faked - but there seems now to have been confirmation. It has been covered in the TMP Idea Lab (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/facebook-confirms-its-surveying-users-about-their-friends-fake-usernames.php?\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), where they say that Facebook has confirmed that they are doing it, and the German online magazine Heise Online (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Facebook-macht-Jagd-auf-Pseudonyme-1633979.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, in German) where they report that it is a 'limited test'. Given that this kind of a test fits in with the official strategy, it seems likely that it is indeed true.</p>\n<p><strong>So what's wrong?</strong></p>\n<p>There are lots of argument against the whole 'real names' policy to start with - it was a trigger for the 'nymwars'. Many people can only really function online with the ability to remain pseudonymous, from bloggers like Nightjack to whistleblowers, from victims of abuse to people living in oppressive regimes. When their pseudonymity is 'broken', the result can be catastrophic - when Nightjack's cover was blown, his blog ceased to exist and a valuable and entertaining source of information was lost. Mexican bloggers have suffered much worse - a number have lost their lives in the most gruesome way when the drugs cartels have been able to find them. The link between the 'online' and the 'offline' personality is one that can often need to be protected. When the 'real names' policy is enforced, protecting that link becomes much, much harder.</p>\n<p>This, of course, is Facebook, which is just one service, rather than the net as a whole - but it's a crucial service, with close to a billion users around the world, pretty close to ubiquitous. And, just as importantly, where Facebook leads, other services can and do follow. If the 'real names' policy becomes accepted on Facebook, it may become the norm. For some people, that sounds like a good thing - catching paedophiles and terrorists, making sure children don't get access to 'inappropriate material' and so forth - but the reality is very different. The real 'bad guys' will find a way around the system - as so often, it will almost certainly be the innocent that get caught up in the messes.</p>\n<p><strong>Snitching</strong></p>\n<p>What's worse, the whole idea of snitching is highly dodgy. There's a good reason that 'telling tales' is looked down on - and a good reason why it's generally only been oppressive regimes (both real and fictional) that have encouraged people to report on their neighbours - from the worst of the Roman Emperors such as Tiberius and Caligula to the KGB, the Stasi and so forth. It's creepy - and it helps build at atmosphere of distrust, breaking down the very things that make social networks good. The social relationships that are the heart of Facebook are meant to do 'good' things - not be a route by which bad things are spread.</p>\n<p>Taking it a step further, look at the nature of the questionnaire. You're being asked to report on a 'friend'. If you say 'I don't want to answer' that will be recorded - that's the whole nature of Facebook - and it's not hard to see that there could be a list of 'people who don't want to answer about their friends'. Indeed, under the terms of the Snoopers Charter, it wouldn't just be Facebook who could access this kind of information: the authorities could potentially set up a filter to gather data on people who don't confirm the names of their friends. It could be viewed as suspicious if you don't answer - or even suspicious if you are friends with people who don't answer. Again, this is the nature of Facebook's social data - and how it could be misused.</p>\n<p>And, as anyone who reads what I write about the Snoopers Charter etc will understand, though this may just be set up to catch paedophiles and terrorists, it can equally be used for all kinds of things. Potential employers who want to see whether their applicants are 'open and honest'. Insurance companies for the same 'reason'. Facebook is now in a situation where it needs to generate income - the failure of its IPO has made this even more crucial than before - and will be looking for ways to squeeze out as much revenue from their data as possible.</p>\n<p>That, ultimately, is what lies behind this kind of thing: Facebook wants to make money. If it knows exactly who you are, it thinks it can make more money from you - by selling things to you, or by selling your details to others, or by targeting you more accurately in some other way. That's perfectly understandable - indeed, from a business sense pretty much inevitable - but it does have consequences, particularly when the other uses that their data can be put are understood.</p>\n<p>Oppressive regimes understand some of those uses - which is one of the reasons that the erstwhile Tunisian government, prior to the revolution, hacked into the Facebook login page in order to be able to access possible revolutionaries' accounts. They knew how that information could be used...</p>\n<p><strong>What should be done?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, the first thing to do is make it clear that you don't like this kind of a system. The whole idea of snitching should not be something that's encouraged - indeed, the whole 'real names' system should be discouraged, but it seems hard to put that genie back into Facebook's bottle. Ultimately, I suspect there's only one answer: many people should simply leave Facebook. Find other ways to do the things you want to do, other ways that don't require 'real names' and don't use such sneaky and creepy tactics as snitching. Communicate by email, by twitter. Share your photos on other photo sites. Play games directly, not over Facebook. There's always another way.</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://paulbernal.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/snitching1.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF;

Yes I have found my way around the email. I was wandering around and about to just drop in on you, but you were amidst some traffic and I would not be responsible for accidents. This email thing is great for quick correspondence but it is the making of horrid handwriting and impatience.</p>\n<p>I learnt about the email from a funny looking man while wandering. He was quite excited about the fact that <strong>we</strong> can get emails. He was American. I could tell by the way he spoke. But dear me he had on some ghastly clothes, and even ghastlier shoes. Overly underdressed!</p>\n<p>Oh the decline of style is the decline of humanity!</p>\n<p>I would not even be caught wearing them as undergarments. Strange name, Jobs. He was quite irritated at the fact that I knew him not. In fact he deemed me ignorant. But his arrogance was a sign, I felt of a sort of genius. He took me to one of those sleek shops selling what I thought was fruit. I did not know that Apples have evolved into cold inedible things. You should tell me these things so I do not look foolish before the younger ones.</p>\n<p>About tea, I can drop in on you anytime. I might have developed a taste for coffee but it is a bitter thing. I rather have a hot bowl of chocolate. A mexican lady served it to me once and I thought it to be just delightful.</p>\n<pre><strong>From</strong>: Raina Ng &lt;r.ng@email.com&gt;\r\n<strong>Subject: </strong> <strong>Tea?\r\n</strong><strong>Date: </strong> September 17, 2012 3:05:12 PM GMT+07:00\r\n<strong>To: </strong>Oscar Wilde &lt;owilde@stillaroundheresomewhere.univ&gt;\r\n<strong>Cc:</strong></pre>\n<p>Dear Oscar,</p>\n<p>I am looking for a way I could invite you to tea again. Screaming and shouting my invitation like the way I did that time has distressed some neighbours.

Total marks awarded to myself: 100.<br />\nI think it is a nice round number, percentage-wise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I still have far more e-mail friends and contacts than I do Facebook friends. <strong>23</strong></li>\n<li>I have 50 folders with subfolders for clients, friends, memberships and so on. I could make some improvements. <strong>-3</strong></li>\n<li>I have sorted the Sent Items into their respective folders too. It is easy to follow correspondence this way. <strong>20</strong></li>\n<li>I last wrote a letter (via e-mail) to my parents in Australia 8 days ago. That is longer than one week. <strong>-10</strong></li>\n<li>I have flagged one minor task to attend to (revision of the second verse of a translation of a poem I did for fun, following the kind parsing in the source language by a friend). My integrity is at stake (\"Don't start something you have no intention of finishing\"). This attracts a modified negative grading, since only two people care. <strong>-8</strong></li>\n<li>All administrative tasks associated with my freelance business are up-to-date. <strong>25</strong></li>\n<li>I have replied to all e-mails received (except of course, junk mail). <strong>18</strong></li>\n<li>I have removed flags from items I have dealt with. <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have deleted outright things I know I will not read, even though they may be of some benefit, knowledge-wise. Too much information is too much information. <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have one e-mail I ought to write (as the initiator of private correspondence). Slap on the wrist for procrastination weighed against its relative importance: <strong>-5</strong></li>\n<li>I have not been able to figure out how to mute the volume on annoying adverts with sounds (or get rid of the adverts altogether) on the Internet, while still turning up the volume on my laptop so that I can hear when new mail arrives. This is annoying. I use a number of online dictionaries and other resources. I have trained my eyes not to look at the adverts, but cannot stand the Grim Reaper laughing at me with a written message in Portuguese asking me, \"Do you know when you are going to die?\". Even thinking about that tiny question would provoke a huge rant from me. I shall be kind to myself in this case. Firstly, I am suffering and secondly, I do not know if it is possible to achieve the desired removal of adverts. Total penalty: <strong>-2</strong></li>\n<li>With my volume on zero, I lost out on a job from a translation agency today because I did not check my inbox for over 30 minutes. I give myself 12 points for working for 30 minutes without being distracted at all, and have deducted 5 for losing out on potential income. Net result: <strong>7</strong></li>\n<li>While clearing out my mail box, and sorting into folders, I discovered three e-mails which I had received and replied to, but had no recollection of the names of the people who had sent them to me. <strong>-5</strong></li>\n<li>At this rate, I shall never get to 100 points. Points for stamina, then: <strong>10</strong></li>\n<li>I have had the same e-mail name since I got my first e-mail account in 2000. Note: I did not really need an e-mail at home until then. Besides which, you needed a telephone line to have an e-mail account, and I did not have one of those at home either. Times have changed, service providers have changed, but the name before the @ is the same. Points to stability, I would say: <strong>15</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how Wordpress copes with the numbered list, and the font colours for the points (blue for positive; red for negative).</p>\n<p>One curious little note on a slang term (which I seldom used myself, not being very slangy by nature): In Zimbabwe years ago, if someone was really entertained with what you had just said, or pleased with the news you had just given them, they would say, \"Ah, 10 points!\". This awarding of points may have come from the fact that the only really interesting thing on television in the 1970s or so was the \"inter-schools quiz\". I don't know; I am guessing.</p>\n<p>A related expression was \"100%\", which signified agreement, and again, pleasure at the receipt of good news. This came into fairly widespread use around 2000. The expression soon changed to \"Ah, hundred\", or \"Ah, hundreds\", or simply, \"Hundreds\". One other theory I have on the shift from \"10 points\" to \"hundreds\" is that it was a reflection of the all-pervasive hyperinflation, and perhaps people thought that 10 was no longer a significantly grand number.</p>\n<p>In any case, I have scored 100 points. Hundreds.</p>\n<p>Allison</p>\n","excerpt":"<div class=\"full\"><img src=\"http://wrightonthebutton.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greenshot_mailbox.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-full\" /></div><p dir='auto'>Thanks to the Post to Email challenge issued by Wordpress, I now have only one unread message in my e-mail folder.

As the teacher looked down at her book, or turned to use the blackboard, a student might tap the person ahead and hand the paper up, or slide it carefully onto the desk at the left. At last the paper reached its intended recipient, whose name was block printed on one of the exposed sides. Her task was to open it, near the front of the classroom, without attracting the notice of the teacher. The message had to reach her during class, or she would pass into the halls and on to her next class without the urgent information in the note.</p>\n<p>By ninth grade, I regularly carried messages (usually just verbal) from a friend in my gym class, to her boyfriend in my English class. When we went on high school or scouting field trips, we were given regular hourly intervals at which each meandering group would \"meet back\" with the rest at a common point to allow the group leaders to count heads. If we went out from home and were late returning, our parents worried and called around to our friends' homes to find out where we were last spotted. (We were always scolded for not calling in on these occasions, as well.)</p>\n<p>Now, all of these things are handled using cell phones which can text, tweet, or email, in addition to just outright calling another person, to make sure no important communication is missed. We indeed live in interesting times.</p>\n<p>Now, in fact, electronic communication is so pervasive that we are seeking ways to limit it. Folks barely look up from their handheld devices as they cross a street, email boxes are full of \"spam\"/electronic junk mail, and we are rudely interrupted by phones ringing (and subsequent personal conversations) in restaurants, elevators, and other public places. Phones light up at the movies, distracting other theater goers, as an impatient recipient reads a text message that just can't wait. Television commercials warn against the serious dangers of texting while driving.</p>\n<p>Today, I read that Apple has received a patent to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"ipod limits\" href=\"http://myscienceacademy.org/2012/09/17/apple-granted-patent-to-disable-iphone-recordings-near-government-buildings-or-political-events/\">restrict iPhone recordings near government buildings and political events</a>. There is an outcry over this limitation of a freedom that, fifty years ago, was pure science fiction. So many benefits, so many issues.</p>\n<p>When I first had email, I rushed home to check my \"mailbox\" every night. Ten years later, I was so battered by the constant barrage of emails at work, and demands for immediate responses, that some nights I didn't even turn my personal computer on. Now I have a phone with texting and IM-ing, a laptop with email (three addresses for different purposes, neatly sorted by Outlook), Skype, Facebook and LinkedIn on both these devices and my Kindle Fire, and the ability to create and email a blog post from anywhere any time.</p>\n<p>These are all wonderful conveniences, but sometimes I just need to unplug. For the last five or six days I've been travelling. I popped into my email and Facebook twice to \"keep up,\" and if a family member had needed to reach me, I had a cell phone. I didn't feel the immediate need to use another device or program. Of course, during that time I neglected my blog, but it was sort of restful.</p>\n<p>I don't Tweet, Facebook, or text my every move (I don't care for it when other people do this, so I won't burden them either.) I don't post my opinions on Facebook (after all this is meant as <em>social media -</em>and weren't we taught not to discuss religion or politics socially?) I have my blog for my random thoughts and opinions (which I post to a separate Facebook page for those who care.) I truly appreciate my friends and followers, and will try to get caught up this week - but I unapologetically enjoyed my e-vacation.</p>\n<p>So, in the event that I'm somewhere away from home, perhaps on a prolonged trip, and I have an urgent need to communicate something on my blog, it will be wonderful that I have that ability from all of my electronic devices through email. I'm giving that a try for the first time with this post, including using some “shortcodes” – for example to tag it. However, just because I <em>can</em> do something with one of these marvelous devices doesn't mean that I necessarily should, or will.</p>\n<p>Time will tell how useful some of these new tech advances will be for me, but who knows? These are, after all, very interesting times.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>\n<p>9/21/12 - A quick addendum - I'm thrilled to advise that this post was selected by WordPress.com to be Freshly Pressed!   Thanks, WordPress!!</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________</p>\n<p><em>This post was written in response to the the WordPress <strong>Weekly Writing Challenge: Mail It In</strong>.

It was a very happy time for us and her addition to our family added to that joy tremendously.  Beatrice was a very special gift because she was so much more than just a dog.  She was full of light and happiness that you could truly see when she pranced into a room.  Bea's heart and her funny quirks inspired me to write this blog.  I called her my Sweet-Bea.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3129\" title=\"628x471\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/628x471.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"419\" /></a></p>\n<p>When we first got Bea, the intention was to show her.  Her lineage was quite impressive and her potential as a show dog was thought to be endless.  Unfortunately for Bea's career, her heart melted ours and the thought of her being on the road at shows, away from us, was too much to bear.  Beatrice was our little lap dog and her place was with us, at home.  Still, the demand for Bea's puppies was high and we had planned to breed her.  In the upcoming months she was to be bred to Baker (a.k.a \"Nautilus Boston Baked Beans\" a US and Canadian champion) with whom the puppies would have been remarkable.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, on our way back to San Francisco after a great summer vacation on the east coast, Beatrice lost her life due to the negligence of United Airlines.  I'm writing this with my anger aside, in the hopes that someone looking for advice will read this and not make the mistake of trusting United with their pets as we did.</p>\n<p>Beatrice had a perfect health record.  She received a full examination and a health certificate four days before the flight, as is required by the Pet Safe program. This program is United's branded on-board pet safety program. In addition to Pet Safe's stringent requirements, we took every extra precaution we could think of.  Both the dog's kennels were labeled front to back with emergency numbers, flight information and warnings.  Their kennels were purchased specifically for the measurements and design specified by Pet Safe.  We purchased special water bowls which we filled with ice to ensure that the water wouldn't spill and that it would last longer. We drove the six hours to New York City from our house in Northern New York State, so the dogs wouldn't have to make a connecting flight.  We paid United Airlines $1800.00, in addition to our plane tickets, to ensure the safety of our pets. Albert and Bea were very prepared travelers.</p>\n<p>When we arrived in San Francisco to pick up our dogs we drove to the dark cargo terminal and on arrival in the hanger were told simply, \"one of them is dead\" by the emotionless worker who seemed more interested in his text messages.  It took thirty minutes for a supervisor to come to tell us, \"it was the two year old.\"  Subsequently we requested that our dog be returned to us and were told that she had been delivered to a local vet for an autopsy. Whatever thread of trust remained between us and United broke and we then insisted that she be returned to us for our own autopsy by our trusted veterinarian, Shann Ikezawa, DVM from Bishop Ranch Veterinary Center. Over the next two hours the supervisor's lie unraveled as it became clear that Bea was right behind a closed door the whole time and he had been discussing how to handle the potential liability with his boss who had left and sticking to the divert and stall tactic that they had been taught. Eventually Bea was returned and we drove her to the vet at midnight.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3134\" title=\"35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/35370_1450573096648_1002847856_31305507_5561783_n.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>William Spangler DVM, PhD performed Beatrice's necropsy (a dog autopsy).  From the findings, it is Dr. Spangler's opinion that Beatrice's death was from  heatstroke.  Our little Beatrice died in pain, scared and alone.  Dr. Spangler also said that \"in my experience it is not unusual for a single dog in airline transit to be affected while other dogs of the same breed survive the trip apparently unscathed.\"</p>\n<p>It will be two weeks since Beatrice was killed by United Airlines and since then United has refused to give us any information about what happened to our beloved little Bea other then, \"our internal investigation does not show any irregularities, as evidenced by the fact that your companion dog and other animals on board did not suffer the same fate\".  I'm not sure why the fact that the other dogs were not killed clears United Airlines but, they seem to think it does.</p>\n<p>They had nothing to say about the fact that the plane had been turned off  (for at least fifteen minutes each time) twice before take-off in Newark, nor did they have anything to say when I requested information about her placement in the plane or about baggage being packed around her.  United Airlines additionally called our veterinarian and fabricated a story about having an email from me, authorizing them to obtain the necropsy results. This, after I specifically told them that we would release the results to them at our discretion.</p>\n<p>Aside from being completely emotionally distraught over the loss of our little Bea, I am so saddened by the complete lack of competence,  honesty and compassion that United has shown.  I am not writing this to start a lawsuit or to get anyone to stop flying United.  I am writing this to help make people aware that airlines are incapable of ensuring the safety of our pets.  All it takes is for one employee to not follow the proper procedure and then like me, your dog is dead.</p>\n<p>I can't say exactly what happened to Beatrice on the plane two weeks ago.  If United had been able to be honest, it would have helped us to find closure.  All I know is what the necropsy told us, Beatrice died from heatstroke.  It is said to be an agonizing death.</p>\n<p>Beatrice should have been happy, healthy and spoiled with us for years and years to come.</p>\n<p>Please don't make the mistake I made that cost our dog her life.  Please, don't trust that an airline will truly care and provide safety to your beloved pet. At some point in the two hours that Bea was in the care of United Airlines before she died, someone made a mistake and because of that, our loving, happy sweet Bea is no longer in our lives.</p>\n<p>I will miss her forever.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3138\" title=\"Photo on 2011-06-30 at 19.14 #4\" src=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://beamakesthreedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/photo-on-2011-06-30-at-19-14-4.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thank you for supporting beamakesthree over the past few years, I greatly appreciate it and have really enjoyed everyone's comments.

This continues to be the case even as I shift to a new role, and now I wonder how Bhutan’s emerging middle class will aspire to consume.</p>\n<p>At a personal level, I try to be a conscious consumer. I am vegetarian because I know of the exponentially greater impacts of meat in terms of water and energy use. I weigh my purchases carefully, buying second-hand when I can and especially choosing quality and durability over quantity. I reuse when possible and then recycle to the point where it annoys most people.</p>\n<p>In my work over the past few years, one theme that has constantly come up is the role that geography and economic development play in sustainable consumption. With 7 billion people on the planet and an inevitable trajectory towards 9 billion, we can no longer be gluttons of consumption in feigned ignorance of the need to allocate resources fairly across the globe. Between now and 2030, 70 million people will join the middle class each year, moving out from under the rock of poverty and into the sunshine of consumption. With this will come increased demand for goods and services associated with a new middle class: mobile phones, washing machines, televisions, cars...</p>\n<p>We checked into our Druk Air flight to Bhutan with an embarrassing 150kg of checked luggage, all too aware of the hypocrisy of being conscious consumers with so much stuff. I brought three cameras, two suits, one bicycle and a lot of painfully selected outdoor clothing and camping equipment. The cognitive dissonance (and excess luggage fees) made us pack carefully, but still the supplies for a year in Bhutan added up.</p>\n<p>In Europe we were conspicuous with the amount of luggage we had, but upon landing at Bhutan’s international airport in Paro, we were quite surprised to find ourselves in good company. As the tourists picked their bags off and the Bhutanese gravitated in<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bhutanchronicles.com/2012/09/18/conscious-consumption-in-bhutan/rtk_0134/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-340\"><img class=\" wp-image-340 alignright\" title=\"Televisions\" src=\"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/v2/placeholder.gif\" original=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0134.jpg?w=450\" alt=\"More than half the pieces on the belt were giant LCD TVs\" width=\"288\" height=\"192\" /></a>to small clusters, the small airport’s only luggage carousel started filling up with boxes. Large and rectangular, box after box lay flat on the belt, their corners hanging over as they navigated the single u-turn on the belt in front of us, and finally I could read the magic letters: LCD. Fully half of the pieces on the carousel were 40 inch flat screen televisions, each soon to channel a nearly infinite amount of full-colour HD aspirations to Bhutan’s new middle class.</p>\n<p>Nearly every individual in this country grew up in an austerity that we cannot even imagine. No electricity, no running water, no refrigeration, no shoes, and of course no radio, television or internet. This was the norm for most of the country 30 years ago. While at a neighbour’s last night, we heard stories how our host, an accomplished artist who has traveled extensively to the United States over the past dozen years, remembers his first pair of Indian shoes with rubber soles which he only acquired as a grown man. Over dinner we were told of his encounter with an Amish community in Tennessee: He simply could not comprehend how a community surrounded by the 21st century would choose to ignore the benefits of light, electricity and the internal combustion engine.</p>\n<p>In turn, I try to understand our host’s antipathy for this conceit of the Amish, (and hide my own appreciation for their austerity). The fact that I haven’t owned a television in a dozen years and make conscious decisions to limit my consumption would probably not make sense to most of my fellow Americans; it would possibly make even less sense to someone in Bhutan who grew up without so many things we take for granted.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bhutanchronicles.com/2012/09/18/conscious-consumption-in-bhutan/rtk_0141/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-339\"><img class=\" wp-image-339 alignleft\" title=\"Baggage\" src=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0141.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://bhutanchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rtk_0141.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"Arriving in Paro with a lot of baggage!\" width=\"315\" height=\"210\" /></a>After nearly five years exploring so many facets of consumption with business leaders and experts from around the world, everything that I have learned has been challenged within minutes of arriving into my new home country.

When kids are young and looking forward to a hot new toy, they sometimes try to approximate its presence in their lives by creating an <em>ersatz</em> model to take the place of the real thing until they can actually touch, hold, and use the real thing. Strangely, this is happening with increasing frequency to the iPhone. The tech world is so hungry for <em>anything</em> iPhone that they will contract graphic designers to create 3D models of the new gadgets, and even go so far as to build full physical models.</p>\n<p>The noise is deafening.</p>\n<p>Post after post featuring blurry component photos hits the interwebs, and the tech press gobbles them up like bacon-stuffed donuts. Most folks don't follow tech blogs, don't really have a pressing desire to know the internal layout of new gadgets, feel no need to really seek this stuff out. They read what falls in their lap and, usually, are better and more sane because of it.</p>\n<p>Then the device hits, and it elicits \"yawns\" from the peanut gallery because they've already seen it all. They make sweeping (often literally global) statements about the reception of the product, about the excitement it's generated, etc. Their actions are, again, childish, just like the kid whose favorite team gets eliminated from the playoffs really early and starts claiming that no one likes [<em>insert sport here</em>] anymore, anyway.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, they're embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Who wouldn't be? Their phones are either knock-offs or faked. The real deal is just that, and consumers know the difference. Companies will try to <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Not on the list: &quot;Runs the Best Mobile OS on the Market (iOS)&quot; (nope), &quot;Works with the App Store&quot; (nada), or &quot;Hasn't Shixpped Yet&quot; (check!)\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/1/3212328/lenovo-thinkpad-tablet-2-features-specifications\" target=\"_blank\">illustrate</a> how their products \"stack up\" against Apple's iPad, or iPhone, or whatever, but it ultimately just makes them look, again, juvenile. I can make a checklist that makes me look like the best human being ever compared to random people on the street. I could create a checklist of the features of a raw, uncooked potato, and compare it to all the features of a slice of deep-dish Chicago pizza, but comparing those two things would make no sense. \"Grows in the ground\", \"Has eyes\", \"Will sprout if placed in water\" are all \"features\" of the potato that the pizza doesn't have, but who really cares? I'll take the pizza thankyouverymuch.</p>\n<p>Which leads me back to my point. The leaked specs, the feature parity, the checklists, etc. are all meaningless in the face of true user experience and the whole package.</p>\n<p>A guy I know had his iPhone run over by a car. It was absolutely destroyed, which was sad for him. He was contemplating purchasing a replacement, but decided to wait it out until his contract was up for renewal so he could purchase a new iPhone 4S. In the meantime, someone gave him a Motorola Droid RAZR (or whatever it's called...these things have the weirdest names). He ditched the Droid in favor of an iPhone 3G. You read that right. He disliked the Droid user experience so much that he went with a molasses-slow (comparatively) phone, simply because the overall user experience was so superior. When you're on the losing team, shouting really loudly and making a lot of noise is still fun, sure, but it doesn't win you ball games. Just ask Cubs fans.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it's clear that people are jazzed about the iPhone 5, and all these \"yawn\" reactions are just the tech news equivalent of Cubs fans getting uppity. People will choose good design and a fluid, beautiful user experience over checklists and noise.</p>\n<p>As they say, it doesn't take a genius.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p dir='auto'>There's something strange that's been happening in the world of tech as hotly anticipated products (primarily of the Apple variety) near launch: the world finds &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">600 more words, 36 comments, 71 likes, 1 link</p>","post_id":525,"guid":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525","permalink":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/embarrassed/","blog_id":"8729525","blog":"Musings of a Forgetful Panda","blogurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348258079,"comment_count":"36","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"4d","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","unlikeurl":"http://paultzirides.wordpress.com/?p=525%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=8729525&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=8729525&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":40,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://s2.wp.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpentimento.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Fjackstaff41.jpg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"tim","author_avatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f23dce32a50bee06a3d8bebd698f5c0e?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Flogo%2Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"Paul Grist: Serious Funny Books","content":"<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2798\" title=\"Let's put our bacon on the table.

Are there people out there who think that the only thing that stopped Bill Watterson being successful was that he didn't draw a realistic tiger? I just try to generate a readability, an immediacy, something that can be recognized and identified with.\"</p>\n<p>After a childhood following artists such as Mike Noble, Frank Bellamy and Gerry Haylock, Grist broke into comics via the UK's small-press scene. His first effort, Short Stories, came to the attention of DC Thomson's girls' comics group, and the publisher offered him work within a week – a contrast to his failure to catch the eye of Marvel and 2000AD, which were proving to be tougher nuts.</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps the lesson is that it's a lot easier to get into those comics that not many other people are aiming for. DC Thomson were great and kept me busy for a couple of years, working primarily on Nikki. I did short humour strips, quiz illustrations, and drew the cover strip for a year or so.\"</p>\n<p>A higher profile arrived in 1989 when Grist illustrated Grant Morrison's St. Swithin's Day, originally for Trident and later reprinted by Oni Press. Morrison's deliberately provocative mix of youthful unrest and anti-Thatcherite bile grabbed some headlines, but at least as much impact comes from the ink-heavy art and its unnerving high contrast. Grist's cartooning does exactly what McCloud describes, turning the troubled protagonist into an ambiguous, queasy mirror.</p>\n<p><strong>LIVING IN EDEN</strong><br />\nKane, the self-published story of New Eden's 39th Precinct and its officers, is where everything clicked. A long-form police procedural, with constant flashbacks to trip up the unwary and sub-plots that looked all set to tumble on forever, the shadowy past of Detective Kane was a sprawling canvas for Grist's imagination to work with.</p>\n<p>When it appeared in 1993, the comparisons were with David Lapham's Stray Bullets and Frank Miller's Sin City - Grist affectionately ribbed Miller's stories several times as he went along - but Kane was a chillier, more humane, and more effective strip. And for readers who found that New Eden's moustachioed SWAT team leader and his taste for excessive violence rang a bell, the strongest influence was clearly from another medium altogether.</p>\n<p>\"Hill Street Blues is very much the template for Kane: multiple storylines with a wide-ranging cast, and a mix of drama and comedy,\" agrees Grist. \"I loved doing Kane. I think in general if you're not working on your favourite comic then you're probably doing it wrong, and it certainly helped get me noticed within the industry.\"</p>\n<p>Grist's storytelling efforts in Kane were certainly noticeable, since he worked the page hard. One issue is told from a fixed vantage point on the rear seat of a patrol car; another makes do without speech or captions. A gangster speaks in a style on loan from Marlon Brando's Don Corleone, via phonetic speech balloons to be unpicked at leisure; Kane himself often says hardly anything. Officer Kate Felix, ever the voice of reason, gets one of the great stand-alone issues of any comic, a childhood incident and present-day crisis running in parallel.</p>\n<p>\"I just try to make the page visually interesting,\" comments Grist. \"Comics are a visual medium, so when people just put one square panel after another, I think they're really not using the medium to its full potential. To me that seems like dancing but not moving your feet.\"</p>\n<p>Kane was the definition of a cult hit, with vocal champions but not a huge readership. The book's narrative became extended by publication delays and threatened to grind to a halt, and some felt that the flashback structure was too hard to follow. \"Kane was very popular with the people who liked it, but sadly there weren't that many of them,\" says Grist looking back. \"Ultimately it just wasn't selling enough for me to be able to continue.\"</p>\n<p><strong>THE PAST IS NEVER DEAD</strong><br />\nAs Kane showed signs of fatigue, Grist responded with Jack Staff, originally aiming to attract readers and then draw them over to Kane. Hence a change of tack: from an American cop to a British superhero. But the tone was recognisably from the same pen.</p>\n<p>\"I tend to see my comics as being a mix of the sombre and the humorous,\" explains Grist. \"Serious funny books. Or funny serious books. Jack Staff is all about cause and effect, rather than nostalgia, but it's also about ageing and death. Jack Staff is someone who is alive forever; Becky Burdock, vampire girl reporter, is dead forever. And together they're facing the End of Everything. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. You can still have a bit of fun along the road.\"</p>\n<p>If Kane was Americana, then Jack Staff is British to the core, loosely formatted in the style of past British action weeklies and seasoned with business from the UK's collective memory. A flashback to 1940 allows for a walk-on by the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard, while the ambiguously spectral Helen Morgan addresses the reader from limbo and views the world through the Play School windows.</p>\n<p>\"I just throw in things that amuse me, really,\" comments her creator. \"None of the in-jokes or references to old British comic characters are important in terms of the story, it's just an extra layer for British readers of a certain age. I hope the story holds up in and of itself, and the fact that readers elsewhere can get it gives me some confidence that it does.\"</p>\n<p>The Americans at Image Comics got it, and picked up the book as a continuing series, leading not only to greater visibility for the strip, but also to a transition into colour.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, colour transforms the effect of Grist's art. The black-and-white Jack Staff is a contemplative, moody strip, sometimes given to introspection. The Image version is a full-colour Hellzapoppin', in which anything goes, the layouts fizz, and the next figure around the corner may be demon, ghoul or giant talking goldfish.</p>\n<p>\"Eric Stephenson contacted me out of the blue and asked if I had ever thought about publishing Jack Staff at Image, to which the only honest answer was no. It  was only when they said that they wanted to publish it as a full-colour comic that it made sense to do it, since that gave me an opportunity to do something that I couldn't do with my own resources. Image also allows me to have everything in print at the same time, which as a self-publisher was something that was proving a bit of a juggling act.\"</p>\n<p>Grist had always wanted to include colour in Jack Staff: \"After all, it's a superhero comic, and superhero comics are always in colour. I like to think of the original series as being a colour comic with a lot of black-and-white pages. But I do still find myself in the mindset of drawing black-and-white pages which are then coloured in. I don't think a black-and-white page is simply a colour page without colour. That's a common mistake in comics, I think.\"</p>\n<p><strong>A PAPER MEDIUM</strong><br />\n\"In 1993 when I started doing Kane there were two big distributors plus several smaller ones, and there were less people actively making comics, so it was a bit easier to get noticed,\" says Grist. \"Now there is a single distributor which has tightened up a lot on what it will distribute, and which expects bar codes and all sorts of other professional malarkey that wasn't asked for in my day. I'm not saying it is a bad thing that Diamond expects to approve the comics that they solicit for, but it makes it just a bit more difficult to get a new comic out there.\"</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the rise of the internet means it has become easier to get work seen by potential readers - whether or not the work is any good, or profitable. But fittingly for an artist with a taste for wrangling the fixed dimensions of a paper page, Grist feels no great urge to decamp onto the internet or create a web comic.</p>\n<p>\"As far as I'm concerned, comics are a paper medium,\" he says. \"This may well be an age thing. I don't find reading comics on screen to be that interesting, so web comics are not something that I'm really planning on exploring in the near future. I did serialise a comic I published, The Eternal Conflicts of the Cosmic Warrior, in a blog, but that was more a case of putting a paper comic on-screen than actually doing a comic for the web.</p>\n<p>\"After years as an active self-publisher, I've now been published by Image for longer than I spent putting out my own books, so I’m really out of the loop as far as self-publishing goes nowadays. But one of the encouraging things about going to comic shows around the UK is that there are new, young people putting out their own comics. Twenty years ago you'd go to the London Convention and the small-press section would be in a corridor leading through to the main hall. Now they've become a main event in their own right. There's a lot of creativity out there, which is very encouraging to see.\"</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2810\" title=\"In the mouth of madness.

I saw the barista faces of my friends long for the opportunity to be surrounded by so much good coffee. While I refrained from telling them just how many Starbucks there were in the city, I did share in their excitement and look forward to experiencing the coffee vibe of this city for myself.</p>\n<p>Today when I woke up I knew that it was time to go to a coffee shop, alone, and see for myself what it felt like here. I know that buying coffee isn’t going to be something I can do on a regular basis, given the absurd price for a cup of joe in this city, but I was feeling lonely and I knew that something familiar would help me feel more at home in this city.</p>\n<p>What would make a barista feel more at home than a coffee shop?</p>\n<p>I opted for a coffee shop close to my aunt’s store called Zoka. As I walked through the large entrance I admired the beautiful woodwork and breathed in the familiar scent of coffee beans.  I noticed that the store was filled with other Seattle natives typing away on their computers or visiting with friends and smiled – this was a picture I was used to.</p>\n<p>When I stepped up to the counter and looked at their menu I refrained from blurting out “You do Pour Over’s too? We’re the only shop in Boise that does that!” though I’m sure my friendly barista would have smiled and not thought I was too weird because of it.</p>\n<p>I ordered my usual and scoped out a spot by the window where I could observe the people who came through the door. Young and old, students and couples, hippies and hipsters all walked through the door and looked like they belonged here. I wondered if I looked like I was supposed to be there too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-201\" title=\"IMG_3690\" src=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"397\" /></a></p>\n<p>My barista poured stunning latte art and I immediately sent a picture to my co-assistant manager back home, knowing he’d appreciate it. I felt another pang of loneliness knowing nobody was here to share this moment with me. But when I complimented my barista on her excellent pouring she smiled and we exchanged a few friendly words before I sat down to write.</p>\n<p>I may not know anyone in this town yet, but I feel comfortable with one of the biggest parts of the culture: coffee. Maybe I haven’t made any friends, but the friendly smiles of others in the coffee shop reassure me that I’ve learned the language here – it’s only a matter of time before I get to speak it with someone.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-202\" title=\"IMG_3692\" src=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zokacoffee.com/\">Zoka Coffee</a></strong></p>\n<p>2901 NE Blakeley Street<br />\nSeattle, WA 98105<br />\n206.527.0990<br />\nMon-Fri: 6am to 9pm<br />\nSat-Sun: 7am to 9pm</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3690.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://raptorcoffee.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_3692.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>When I first started working at the District Coffee Shop, my boss told me “Coffee is a universal language.

It took no convincing for me to plan this for my students, realizing the impact it could have on their world perspectives. It is so challenging for students to grasp this immense planet and consider that they might \"make a mark\" on it!</p>\n<p>The story, if you are not familiar, is of a girl named Vashti who believes she cannot draw.  After being instructed to simply make a mark on the paper and sign it, she discovers that her teacher truly values that mark and Vashti challenges herself to create even more kinds of dots.</p>\n<p>On the Morning Message I told them to look for a piece of paper on their desks.  I had placed different colored dots in different locations on the paper and instructed the students to simply \"see where the dot takes you!\" So much interesting artwork resulted from the simple prompt.<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg\"><br />\n<img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"IMG_0541\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>                                  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"IMG_0542\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>After reading the book, we began to build the idea of the dot metaphor.  What does it mean to make your mark on the world? On our class? On our school? The idea was still a bit fuzzy to them, so we wrote about our talents, our smarts, (we have been exploring the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Intelligence\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple Intelligences</a>) and considered how these talents might help others around us.</p>\n<p>Then, we Skyped with another 3rd grade class at an international school in Berlin, Germany.  Lining up the time was tricky, since there was a 6 hour time difference. However, Ms. Victor (@victortweets) hosts a book club after school, so our group of 35 3rd graders got to talk to her 5 students attending the club that day!  I loved the dot activity they shared- their artwork displayed original dots each student created, representing different positive \"marks\" they wanted to make on the world...happiness, caring...etc.  This really helped my students to begin to generalize the idea of making your \"mark\".</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-540 aligncenter\" title=\"IMG_0532\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p> Finally, we extended this activity to relate to our classroom behavior by considering: What mark do we want to make on our classroom? Together we created a list of qualities we hoped our classmates saw in each other.  Our mission then was to create abstract artwork showing the mark we wish to make on our class community, a \"dot\" to represent the quality they hope their classmates see within. Last week we learned about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learningtogive.org/lessons/unit72/lesson3.html\">Random Acts of Kindness</a>, and I think connecting these random \"marks\" made will help them to understand even more, the power of their mark.</p>\n<p>They were so excited about the idea of \"connecting the dots\" between New Hampshire and Germany, and I could read amazement and disbelief on their faces that we were actually talking to other kids so far away...but seemingly so close. I look forward to capitalizing on the power of Skype to continue expanding the students' worlds. While creating a dot to represent personal qualities is an extremely abstract thought, I knew that many students understood when they began writing and sharing their explanations of the art work.  Students considered size, color, placement, pattern etc. with regards to the represented quality.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-541 alignleft\" title=\"IMG_0539\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>                     <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-542 alignright\" title=\"IMG_0540\" src=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></p>\n<p>Truly an experience with literal, metaphorical, personal, and global components.  Truly the way learning comes alive for learners.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related Posts</h6>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Day 2 in Review at #BLC12: Innovation is Questioning in Action\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/day-2-in-review-at-blc12-innovation-is-action-answering-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">Day 2 in Review at BLC '12</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"#BLC12- Favorites from Day One: Choice and Assessment!\" href=\"http://soulstrikers.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/blc12-favorites-from-day-one-choice-and-assessment/\" target=\"_blank\">BLC '12: Favorites from Day One...</a></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://childrensbooksheal.com/2012/08/27/international-dot-day-sept-15-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">International Dot Day - Sept. 15, 2012</a> (childrensbooksheal.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelamaiers.com/2012/09/promoting-student-engagement-make-your-mark.html\" target=\"_blank\">Promoting Student Engagement ~ Make Your Mark</a> (angelamaiers.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelamaiers.com/2012/09/skype-in-the-classroom-connecting-dots-between-schools-students-and-communities.html\" target=\"_blank\">Skype In the Classroom - Connecting Dots between Schools, Students and Communities</a> (angelamaiers.com)</li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://s0.wp.com/imgpress?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peterhreynolds.com%2Fdot%2FsmDot.jpg&resize=84,84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0541.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0542.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0532.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0539.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://soulstrikers.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_0540.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>Monday was my first experience Skyping my class around the world!

I will start with the work side; later I will visit the ‘life’ side.</p>\n<p>In 2002 I was a Space Shuttle Flight Director at the Johnson Space Center.  Not only that, I was the Deputy Chief of the Flight Director’s Office for Space Shuttle Operations. That meant that I had managerial responsibilities; personnel responsibilities, budgetary responsibilities.  Oh, that last one, about budget – we will visit that again in a later post.  How I hated budget responsibilities in an era of cost cutting.</p>\n<p>Life was a continuous round of meetings, teleconferences, and management decisions.  I regularly attended the Shuttle Program management meetings and had input into many of the decisions that were made in those days.  We evaluated in flight anomalies, provided recommendations on the budget, questioned technical issues, and tried to pay attention to everything.  Even though the organization chart showed I was in the Mission Operations organization, we were all part of “the Program”.</p>\n<p>I had just come off a successful Lead Flight Director assignment in December 2001 for STS-108/ISS UF-1.  Being a lead flight director is a year long assignment; the Lead Flight Director is responsible for all aspects of mission planning, training, and execution for a shuttle flight.  It was a tremendous amount of pressure and a huge satisfaction when it was over.  ISS Utilization Flight-1, commanded by Dom Gorie, was a logistics flight with a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module full of supplies and a large quantity of scientific experiments for the ISS.  The most emotional part of the flight was the 9/11 remembrance which got punted to me.  The list of mission objectives was long.  We completed them all, just another 100% successful shuttle mission.  Except for the inflight anomalies on the shuttle system, nothing untoward occurred, and even those were nothing to worry about.  Or so we thought.</p>\n<p>It was my third, and as it turned out, last assignment as a Lead Flight Director.</p>\n<p>Every shuttle flight has three to five Flight Directors assigned.  One FD was the Ascent/Entry guy - my usual job.  The A/E FD worked shifts prelaunch, launch, went to in standby/monitor mode for the middle of the flight, and then worked one pre-deorbit shift (Flight Control System Checkout day) and the Entry shift.  Or Entry shifts, as weather caused frequently delays.  During most of the flight, while the on-orbit flight directors were in charge, the A/E FD could be found most often in the JSC Weather office kibitzing with the meteorologists, eating their food (they always had the best snack layout), hanging out in the back row of the MMT, and generally being a nuisance.  During the ‘on-orbit’ period, there were three shifts of roughly eight hours each, cleverly named the Orbit 1, Orbit 2, and Orbit 3 shift.  Sometimes we called the Orbit 3 shift (when the crew was asleep), the Planning shift because every “night” the plan would be reviewed, modified, and changes sent up to the astronauts.  If the flight was more than about 10 days long, an additional Orbit team would be assigned to allow the three primary shifts to have a day off.  Shift schedule planning could be complex.  Typically the Lead Flight Director worked the Orbit 1 shift.  But on every flight, because the FD had to stay in the Mission Control Room working the minute by minute details, a manager from the Mission Operations organization was assigned to be the go between from the flight control team and the on-console flight directors to the Mission Management Team, aka NASA senior management.  The Mission Operations Director had several formal duties, most important of which was as a member of the MMT.  The MOD did not work a specified shift but was always in the MCC during the most critical and dynamic times.  So when the on-console FD was under the most stress, that was the precise moment when the MOD, the FD “boss” would show up: to sit on the console directly behind the FD, and offer “advice” and “encouragement” and write up performance appraisals.  The MOD, along with the Lead Flight Director, also flew to KSC for the Flight Readiness Review about two weeks before launch where about a hundred of the NASA senior managers met face to face to ensure the shuttle was ready for launch. </p>\n<p>I was assigned to be the MOD for the 4<sup>th</sup> Hubble Space Telescope servicing Mission, STS-109, which flew in March of 2002.  It was a hectic mission with lots of little issues, but no big ones that I recall.  I hope I wasn’t too much of a nuisance to the flight control team doing the real work!</p>\n<p>Finally, for 2002, I was assigned as the STS-113 A/E Flight Director.   STS-113 or ISS Assembly Flight 11A carried a huge solar array – Port Array #1 – up to the ISS.  Jim Wetherbee was the commander.  We were all informed of the in flight anomalies from the previous flight, STS-112.  Among those anomalies was the loss of a large segment of insulating foam from the External Tank which fell and struck the left hand Solid Rocket Booster.  This strike left a large smudge on the steel case.  We Flight Directors speculated that if that piece of foam had struck a critical electronic box on the SRB not far from where the smudge was located, that BAD THINGS might have happened. But then, we Flight Directors were always worry warts.  At the FRR the foam loss was deemed “not a safety of flight issue”.  The A/E FD does not go to FRRs.  In retrospect, of course, I wish I had gone.  Maybe I could have gotten the captain to turn the Titanic away from the iceberg.  But that didn’t happen.  No significant foam loss occurred on STS-113, so we all shrugged and agreed it had been a one time thing. </p>\n<p>We were wrong.  STS-113 was the last successful entry of a space shuttle flight for three years. </p>\n<p>We all knew that Jim Wetherbee was slated to take over JSC’s office of Safety and Mission Assurance right after his flight; so for a humorous moment, I got on the Air to Ground radio after the landing and spoke with him.  It is not typical, but not all that unusual, for a Flight Director to pre-empt the CAPCOM and talk directly with the crew.  After the successful landing I was in a jocular mood so just before Wetherbee was to leave the cockpit, I called him up (you can probably find the recording somewhere) and congratulated him on a successful flight and told him “your desk in Building 1 [JSC’s management building] is waiting for you”.  Fate is funny;  it turned out that prophecy applied to me too, but I didn’t know it at the time.</p>\n<p>It was my last time to sit at the Flight Director’s chair in Mission Control.  Best job of my life; I miss it every day; but it was over and I didn’t know it.</p>\n<p>So work was a 60 hour a week job; it was always on my mind.  There were a thousand details to plan and decide and brief to management.  Even then I recognized that there were a million details in the shuttle business that I couldn’t participate in; there just wasn’t enough time or energy for any one person to do it all.  The folks in the shuttle program office, Ron Dittemore, Linda Ham, and the rest, they had a tough job.  Tougher than you know.  Tougher than I knew at the time.  Everybody played their part, everybody was highly motivated, everybody wanted the shuttle to succeed, and yet, within months, we were all to fail. </p>\n<p>Why?  Listen and learn.  Maybe you will avoid failure.  But don’t count on it.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p dir='auto'>When you are in a High Reliability Organization, you have to pay attention.  The more extreme the risk, the more difficult the environment, the more &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">1,478 more words, 31 comments, 44 likes</p>","post_id":248,"guid":"http://waynehale.wordpress.com/?p=248","permalink":"http://waynehale.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/ten-years-after-columbia-balancing-life-and-work/","blog_id":"14926741","blog":"Wayne Hale&#039;s Blog","blogurl":"http://waynehale.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348058557,"comment_count":"31","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"6d","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://waynehale.wordpress.com/?p=248%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","unlikeurl":"http://waynehale.wordpress.com/?p=248%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=14926741&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=14926741&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":44,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://s1.wp.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fthebumplife.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Fimg_4799.jpg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"The Bump Life","author_avatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/301498dbc6e3beab860a8fd12220be70?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Fblavatar%2F58153214f3c8ab9ee2127fa43fbdaa28%3Fs%3D64%26d%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fs0.wp.com%252Fi%252Flogo%252Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"On Humility and Turds","content":"<div id=\"attachment_697\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thebumplife.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/parentingreward.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://thebumplife.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/parentingreward.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-697\" title=\"parentingreward\" src=\"http://thebumplife.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/parentingreward.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://thebumplife.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/parentingreward.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"Parenting's Reward\" width=\"610\" height=\"490\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My sweet little slice of humble pie</p>\n</div>\n<p>A few mornings ago, I unzipped my son’s sleep sack and two perfectly round turds popped out, fell to the floor and rolled under the changing table.</p>\n<p><em>Thunk, thunk, rooollllll. </em></p>\n<p>I stood there, frozen, thinking, <em>how did those turds escape?, </em>only to proceed further and discover my son’s pajamas were unsnapped and up around his waist. His diaper, pee-stained but turd-free, was unfastened and resting at the bottom of the sleep sack. Poop was <em>everywhere</em>.</p>\n<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my time as a mom, it’s the importance of humility.</p>\n<p>The funny thing was, I had just had lunch with a friend the day before the turd incident, and humility was the very thing we were discussing. I had recently been involved in quite a few conversations with other moms that had carried a pretty judgmental tone. Whenever I encounter moms bashing other moms for their parenting styles or decisions — or even just talking in a know-it-all fashion — I think about humility.</p>\n<p>The most common fodder for the “Mommy Wars” that have gotten so much press lately is the decision to work a traditional job or stay home to raise kids. What those engaged in this silly battle seem to overlook is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to life, and there are challenges no matter which road you choose to take.</p>\n<p>Wendy Goffe writes in her article, “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2012/04/15/a-working-mom-defends-the-lululemon-stay-at-home-mother/\" target=\"_blank\">A Working Mom Defends the 'Lululemon Stay-at-Home Mother'</a>” that she’s thankful for her job and ability to pay for a nanny, because she doesn’t “have the skills to raise five children.”</p>\n<p>There are days when I don’t believe I have those skills either. Especially on mornings when I find I’ve failed to perform the simple act of properly fastening a diaper so my son’s legs don’t wind up smeared in poop. When you’re a stay-at-home-mom and fastening diapers is a pretty prominent part of your job description, that’s a demoralizing feeling.</p>\n<p>What gets me through the day is humility. I remind myself that I don’t have it all figured out, and that’s okay. It’s okay to be intimidated by the supreme responsibility of raising a human being from an infant to a man. Shouldn’t we all be?</p>\n<p>Contrary to the fussy, colicky baby I prepared for throughout my pregnancy, my son sleeps through the night, eats well, plays independently and has a happy demeanor most of the time. I consider this nothing more than immensely good fortune, and I thank my lucky stars for him nearly every day.</p>\n<p>If anything, this makes me <em>less</em> qualified to judge a mom whose baby cries incessantly, or wakes several times a night for months on end or refuses to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. What do I know about that mom’s struggle? What makes me think I would handle those challenges better?</p>\n<p>And, also, there’s this one little thing about parenting that we all have to remember: <em>things change. </em></p>\n<p>After months of sleeping beautifully, my son recently starting waking up crying in the middle of the night. At times I worried my parenting luck had run out. But we got through what turned out to be a simultaneous growth spurt and rough teething patch. Now, we’re dealing with a new challenge: his proclivity for biting. <em>Hard. </em></p>\n<p>That three-week span when I found myself rocking a crying baby in the middle of the night, I thought about how fortunate I’ve been. I can’t imagine how much strength it would take to deal with that all the time. I don’t judge moms who have had a tough road with their babies; <em>I admire them. </em>I sympathize. I raise my fist in solidarity with them.</p>\n<p>And I sure hope those moms who have never had to wipe up after a turd on the loose don’t judge me.</p>\n<p>*       *       *       *       *</p>\n<p>Welcome to those of you who found my blog via Freshly Pressed!

Watching the swifts is one of my favorite fall activities in this city, as hundreds of people come out with their families and friends and have picnic dinners on the steeply sloped hill, while watching thousands of birds swirl into the chimney at sunset. It’s a beautiful community event and I try to go see it at least a few times during the season.</p>\n<p>But, last night turned out to be more than just a nice night of watching the beauty of nature and the strength of community. I learned something about myself that took me by surprise and has left me a bit unsure of where to go next. It came about during a conversation about past relationships, in which I said to my friend, “we broke up because we fought too much…although I have never fought with anyone else I’ve dated…” and then it hit me; I haven’t fought with ANYONE else since we broke up, not boyfriends, not friends, not bosses, not my mother, not anyone. Suddenly I was slapped in the face with the realization that for the past 4 years I have been avoiding conflict at all costs.</p>\n<p>I knew that I had changed quite a bit since the summer of 2008, and I often liked my new amicable self, but I also had slowing been losing my path, unable to make decisions, developing patterns of self isolation and becoming even more flighty than before. I had many potential explanations for my behavior; my most important long-term relationship had ended, I was in graduate school, the economic recession was making opportunity sparse, and I was dealing with issues of self worth and confidence. All normal things that happen in life, but for 4 years I had been trying to address these issues so that my life could be better and I could maybe discover some idea of how to live my dreams, but nothing ever worked.</p>\n<p>So over the last 4 years I have looked at everything in this quest for clarity; my jobs, my living situations, my diet, my hobbies, my friends, my spirituality, everything. I have sought out therapy, Naturopaths, energy work, new friends, new adventures, new jobs and homes, but still nothing brought me to a place that felt right. It was like I forgot who I was and I was now just trying on different lives to see if they fit. I developed an inability to make real decisions instead opting for whatever presented itself to me in the moment. But, it never occurred to me that most of this might be the result of developing a pervasive avoidance of conflict.</p>\n<p>Now I think it is reasonable to avoid unnecessary conflict, but when you avoid conflict at all costs you become willing to give up just about everything in order to keep the peace. You give up your hopes, desires, and the things that are most important to you. You isolate yourself from any situation that might evoke deep emotions. And you find ways to justify people’s bad behavior so as not to have to confront it. Avoiding conflict makes you begin to think that being nice is more important than being authentic.</p>\n<p>Over the years I have started to feel successful in my interpersonal life because people began to perceive me as nice and pleasant to be around. I no longer got comments that I was “opinionated” and “bitchy”. People would talk about how kind and diplomatic I was. Which are all great things to be and it felt good to be this way, but it has all been at the expense of pursing my passions and dreams. I have not found a balance; I just swung from one extreme to the other.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-1.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-1.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1142\" title=\"Swifts  1\" src=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-1.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-1.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"792\" /></a></p>\n<p>And now I can see so clearly how it all started and it had nothing to do with my ex boyfriend that I did all the fighting with (it just occurred around the same time we broke up). It was during my second year serving in AmeriCorps, where I worked as an environmental educator in the mountains of Idaho. For the first three months everything was great, I loved my coworkers, my job and the town. As a group we worked well together and had a great dynamic. We did however avoid any real conflict which left things stewing under the surface, unaddressed. Then, just after winter break everything changed; the group finally let what was simmering come out and conflict erupted into an all out battle. And as an opinionated, stubborn, process oriented person I met it head on with dire consequences. I became the group’s scapegoat for all conflict; everything was my fault, which it sometimes was, but definitely not always.</p>\n<p>For months every time the group had an issue I would be placed in the central point of blame and criticized for anything I said or did. It was horrible and I didn’t know what to do to fix it. I was in a constant state of anxiety and defensiveness. It wasn’t until I came down with a fortunate (yes I said fortunate) case of food-poisoning in which I was out of commission for a whole week and the group (in my absence) continued to have conflict and therefore had to acknowledge that maybe it wasn’t always my fault. A few of my coworkers decided to stand up for me and bring the issue of how I was being treated to the group. So, after months of dealing with conflict by making me the scapegoat, we finally had to address the real issues that were plaguing our group and I was finally allowed to move on with my life without constant harassment and negativity.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately by this point, I had already completely shut down and must have subconsciously vowed never to do anything that would put me in that position again. I turned inward, began to avoid groups, and quickly lost my ability to make decisions. I became paralyzed with anxiety over doing anything that might upset someone or make someone think I was being contrary. I stopped speaking up or asking for what I wanted. And unfortunately, I was never able to make the connection that my sudden change in personality and behavior came from this very difficult experience and the resulting subconscious coping strategies.</p>\n<p>And I now realize that my coping strategies have consumed my life. Being unable to make decisions, I stared to create predictable patterns that make my decisions for me. I go to the same restaurants, order the same foods, do the same things with the same people on a regular basis, wear the same clothes and generally leave the rest up to chance. I have learned to always be ok with whatever anyone else chooses, I no longer am a picky eater, I reserve my opinions for groups of people I know agree with me (and I can always see the opposition’s side and understand why they feel the way they do), I avoid people who I know have strong beliefs and tend to get worked up over them, and I spend more and more time alone.</p>\n<p>I even recently decided that I wanted to live alone (even though I have a great, affordable house, with great roommates) because I feel like I’m always having to compromise, never acknowledging though that I never ask for what I want, never being willing to address my concerns or feelings with the people I live with. I would rather move out than discuss something that might not be pleasant. I’d rather run away than make things work.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-3.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-3.jpg?w=600\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1144\" title=\"Swifts  3\" src=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-3.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-3.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"349\" /></a></p>\n<p>So, that brings me to today. This whole realization just came crashing down in a torrent of insight and clarity, but now I don’t know what to do with it. Seeking out conflict doesn’t seem like the answer, but I clearly need to face my fear and maybe learn about strategies for effective conflict resolution instead of conflict avoidance. I know I don’t want to go through the rest of my life not authentically living with purpose because I am too afraid of being criticized or attacked for my choices. I want to have the courage to follow my dreams even if it may involve some unpleasantness. And I want to find a balance between being kind and diplomatic and being strong and living with conviction.</p>\n<p>It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even know what I want anymore because it has just been easier to go with the flow and let things happen, than to risk being confronted for my choices. The problem is that this is incredibly uninspiring and leaves me feeling lost and confused most of the time as well as dependent on the spontaneity of others to keep my life interesting and fulfilled. And it makes my relationships unbalanced and inauthentic and leaves me feeling isolated from those I care about.</p>\n<p>So, I guess my lesson is that sometimes going and watching the swifts is just a nice way to pass the time, but sometimes watching animals live out their purpose in life makes us question our own and helps us better understand our true nature. Fear is an amazingly powerful thing that can bury us under its weight if we don’t keep it in check. If the swifts were afraid of coming home to roost because of the peregrine falcons that prey on them each season, then the whole ecosystem would collapse. The swifts don’t avoid their journey because of the battle that awaits them at that chimney, they show up every year without fail and remind us that the journey is hard, but we have to go on it anyway.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-2.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-1.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://theperpetualvagabond.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/swifts-3.jpg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>Last night I went to watch the swifts in Portland, who every September on their fall migration roost in the chimney of Chapman School in &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">1,630 more words, 61 comments, 178 likes, 3 links, 3 images</p>","post_id":1141,"guid":"http://theperpetualvagabond.com/?p=1141","permalink":"http://theperpetualvagabond.com/2012/09/18/the-swifts-conflict-decision-making-and-following-my-dreams/","blog_id":"23661310","blog":"The Perpetual Vagabond","blogurl":"http://theperpetualvagabond.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348002500,"comment_count":"61","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"6d","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://theperpetualvagabond.com/?p=1141%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","unlikeurl":"http://theperpetualvagabond.com/?p=1141%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=23661310&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=23661310&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":46,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://s1.wp.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmonkeymoonmachine.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Fimg_6248.jpg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"MonkeyMoonMachine","author_avatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f9815331c6e870a8b372510b74ac85f1?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Flogo%2Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"Poetry: Drafts of 'Split My Thumb'","content":"<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monkeymoonmachine.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6248.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-173\" title=\"IMG_6248\" src=\"http://monkeymoonmachine.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6248.jpg?w=600\" original=\"http://monkeymoonmachine.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6248.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>Last week, in the creative writing classes I teach, we read Richard Hugo's essay \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ualr.edu/rmburns/RB/hugosubj.html\" target=\"_blank\">Writing off the Subject</a>,\" and then I asked my students to write a poem in the way Hugo describes: starting from a particular idea, following the lead of one's inner voice to end up at a new idea, a new place, something one hadn't planned to say (Hugo implies a method like that in his discussion of \"Autumn Leaves\"). I followed the same instructions, and below are two free-writing drafts before the final (for now) draft.</p>\n<p>But here's the difficulty, of course: the real writing process is in my mind, and what's in the drafts below is only the residue. Since my mind during freewrites tends to work associatively, I can't explain why one thing led to another. And I can't describe why I ended up with the poem I did, except to say that it felt right, it felt interesting. It might not even interest me later.</p>\n<p>A student brought up a good question: when does an artist ever know when a poem is ready for publishing on a blog?  I don't really know, I said, thinking out loud that the costs are low, which encourages publishing, but is the poem worth sharing? That answer requires thinking about what readers might appreciate, but also about being willing to send writing out that isn't perfect. I guess my answer for these things below is  that the creative writing process is mysterious enough, and fascinating enough, that I want to discuss it, and these are at least a model, if a poor one.</p>\n<p><strong>Freewrite 1</strong></p>\n<p>(The two freewrites were hand-written, but the final poem was composed via word-processor. This freewrite started from the prompt word \"surge,\" given by a random word-lookup technique -- picking shards of words out of newsprint that had been through a shredder -- and an image/memory of a finger being jammed while playing basketball came to mind.)</p>\n<p><em>Surge into the top joint, the basketball did, and rough skin slid back into my hand and pores spread open, air met body, lines decline to limit the me from the sky -- the nearby sky the air-ocean we are pressed down by – impressed – tender is the light that strikes us – surge, the burst surges out from me and yet I stay the hand, the skin the sh!t box – swipe the keen face of the tandem bike rhizomes – strawberry marmalade takes tokens from toad </em></p>\n<p><strong>Freewrite 2:</strong></p>\n<p>(I took \"rough skin\" and \"tandem bike rhizomes\" from the previous freewrite, and then tried to let go, encourage words to come to mind without being too particular about which words got written down. It's a process skill that has taken me a while to get good at doing.)</p>\n<p><em>Rough skin slid back into my hand and pores spread open.  The world – the air confronts an enemy, the closed sealed entombed world of the blood – the inner sanctum where air is blocked – and tandem bike rhizomes – and air is the enemy, air is the enema, and toads kill the healing vice – the red rice bucks company plans – the rough skin slid again (over?) my hand – pores opened, veins poured open, the blood leaks like a radiator, like a brake line, and I push and no resistance – the blood leaks out – it’s under pressure inside, like a break line, like a family – the air is the enemy but the body pushes out the blood – the air-skin boundary – where I stop – leaks into air – where a r becom – I likes into a r to become “air” – where I becomes it</em></p>\n<p><strong>Final -- for now -- draft:</strong></p>\n<p>I liked the image of the air-ocean and the body-air boundary, but wanted to be more concrete, less philosophical here, and so I went with a description of an event that really had happened to me days earlier, which event-image had been in my mind as I had written earlier about the body-boundary. This poem is  blunt, which was an intentional -- at this point in the process -- choice of voice/mood, and so I was restricting my word choices to one-syllable ones where possible. When I am less self-restrictive, more automatically voiced, in my freewriting, longer words tend to come out (see my recent poem, written the same week, using a similar process, called \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monkeymoonmachine.com/2012/09/16/poem-the-whistle-of-heat/\" target=\"_blank\">The Whistle of Heat</a>\").  I made a choice to use spare language here, to show as rawly, bluntly, physically as possible, the action -- with my impulse to make interpretive associations held in check.</p>\n<p><em>The stainless-steel paring knife </em><br />\n<em>splits my thumb where it </em><br />\n<em>backstopped </em><br />\n<em>a tough tomato skin. </em><br />\n<em>Blood comes to the air. </em><br />\n<em>A paper towel </em><br />\n<em>records</em><br />\n<em>the blood drop </em><br />\n<em>as a red dot. </em></p>\n<p>This was where the poem stopped as the class period ended, but I was feeling like there could have been more added to it. I'm not sure more was needed, I'm not sure what the more would be, but I remind myself that poems don't need to be long -- I'm just not sure I'm entirely satisfied with this poem being short.</p>\n<p>But I do like the simplicity of the images: skin being split by a knife, blood \"comes\" (\"oozes\" or \"spurts\" didn't seem right, nor did the idea from earlier of blood under pressure seem interesting in the end) to air, and the implication of the verb \"record\" -- that the body may not keep the record of the blood, blood being temporarily and not permanently liquid, but that the paper might -- our bodies write themselves into their surroundings, the 3-D drop of blood becoming a 2-D stain, etc.  As I talk <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">about</span> the poem, I could associate further, but this poem's strength, such as it is, comes from being minimal.</p>\n<p>Of course, this demonstration can't really be a tutorial of how to write a poem -- a new poem, at its most creative, has no model, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/stray-questions-for-kay-ryan/\" target=\"_blank\">so is a new island</a>, so this  demonstration cannot be imitated the way other modeled skills can be. And writing about a process like this feels like that quote about how writing about music is like tap dancing about sculpture (or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/11/08/writing-about-music/\" target=\"_blank\">various other activities</a>).  A new poet must figure out her own process.  But as a teacher, I'd hope to give at least an idea of a path -- those suggestions seemed to help me, I recall.</p>\n","excerpt":"<div class=\"full\"><img src=\"http://monkeymoonmachine.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/img_6248.jpg?w=600\" class=\"size-full\" /></div><p dir='auto'>Last week, in the creative writing classes I teach, we read Richard Hugo's essay \"Writing off the Subject,\" and then I asked my students to &hellip;</p> <p class=\"read-more\">1,036 more words, 38 comments, 120 likes, 5 links, 1 image</p>","post_id":161,"guid":"http://monkeymoonmachine.com/?p=161","permalink":"http://monkeymoonmachine.com/2012/09/16/poetry-drafts-of-split-my-thumb/","blog_id":"27990237","blog":"MonkeyMoonMachine","blogurl":"http://monkeymoonmachine.wordpress.com","blog_public":null,"ts":1348023347,"comment_count":"38","pluralized_comment":"Comments","ago":"6d","liked":false,"likeurl":"http://monkeymoonmachine.com/?p=161%3Flike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","unlikeurl":"http://monkeymoonmachine.com/?p=161%3Funlike%3D1&amp;_wpnonce=3806cabbbb","aside":false,"external":false,"follow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=27990237&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","unfollow_url":"http://wordpress.com/following?b=27990237&amp;unsub=1&amp;_wpnonce=c9fce605b3","following":0,"position_in_the_main_list":47,"filter_type":"fp"},{"fp_bg_image":"http://s1.wp.com/imgpress?w=450&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdailypost.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F09%2Fa-space-for-learning-2.jpeg&#038;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3","avatar":"http://en.wordpress.com/wp-content/themes/h4/i/mobile/subs-rss-mobile.png?cached","author_name":"Cheri Lucas","author_avatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/36207d4c7c014b0999b995ca3971d383?s=64&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Fblavatar%2F7eb290aaccb7d769c6a84369a0a83f3d%3Fs%3D64%26d%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fs0.wp.com%252Fi%252Flogo%252Fgray-white-transparent-64.png&amp;r=G","title":"What Makes a Post Freshly Press-able: A Space For Learning","content":"<p><em>Every day, 19 WordPressers are featured on the Freshly Pressed section of WordPress.com.

She tackles something topical—NASA's space exploration—but also uses personal experience to frame and shape the post. Through this lens, she weaves a unique and much larger discussion about the state of 21st-century education.</p>\n<p>Here are three ways she does this:</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>She uses a metaphor to connect disparate topics in a natural way.</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://spacesforlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/earths-orbit-the-silhouet-002.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-10204\" title=\"A Space For Learning\" src=\"http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-space-for-learning-2.jpeg?w=600\" original=\"http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-space-for-learning-2.jpeg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>In the introduction, Pamela grounds us by recounting a recent talk by retired space shuttle astronaut Kathy Thornton. Kathy said NASA abandoned the shuttle program—a tough decision—to dream up a new, bold human narrative of space exploration for the 21st century that moves beyond orbiting Earth. \"Otherwise,\" writes Pamela, \"the current program doomed NASA’s astronauts to circling the globe in low space orbit, over and over and over again.\"</p>\n<p>After describing this evening with Kathy, Pamela states:</p>\n<blockquote><p> I thought that night—just like kids doomed to sitting in rows, facing the same direction, doing 20th century test prep worksheets over and over and over again. When she finished speaking, I couldn’t help but think that <em>we educators </em><em>are caught in low orbit work, too.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>I felt that Pamela's connection between the abandonment of the space shuttle program and the stunted state of education is natural and fitting, evoking visuals of shuttles in low orbit and apathetic students at desks. You don't have to be a space enthusiast or educator to understand this metaphor. Through it, she weaves a fresh, intriguing discussion about two separate topics: space exploration and education.</p>\n<p>If you want to experiment with metaphors in your own posts, consider different subjects that interest you. Can you find connections? Crafting a metaphor can be tricky, and you need to be sure the comparison you are drawing is not contrived. Furthermore, using a metaphor may not be appropriate for every post. Read your writing aloud to be sure it makes sense and doesn't sound forced.</p>\n<h2>The language is appropriate and accessible.</h2>\n<p>A commenter on last week's \"What Makes a Post Freshly Press-able?\" post talked about the <em>authority </em>of a blogger. Must a writer be an <em>expert</em> to write about a topic? Fellow bloggers commented that we don't have to be seasoned journalists or established sources to share our thoughts; the blogosphere has room for many modes of writing.</p>\n<p>That said, Pamela establishes credibility in both space exploration and education through her word choice. In the first paragraph, she writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[Kathy's] earned that right, having been key to several major payload deployments into space including the first service work on the Hubble telescope. She’s a real-deal spacewalker.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://spacesforlearning.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/curiosity.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-10208\" title=\"Curiosity\" src=\"http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/curiosity-2.jpeg?w=600\" original=\"http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/curiosity-2.jpeg?w=600\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"199\" /></a>Above, Pamela establishes her authority with insider speak such as \"payload deployments.\" But in the next sentence, she balances the jargon with more accessible language: \"she's a real-deal spacewalker.\" She's authoritative, but doesn't distance herself from us.</p>\n<p>She also strengthens her metaphor with precise (and evocative) word choice. She uses phrases like \"shuttling test prep cargo\" and plays with language:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If NASA is doing it, shouldn’t we also “go boldly where no educators have gone before?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reworking a well-known phrase, like this one from <em>Star Trek, </em>may help readers to identify with your topic and engage in your discussion.</p>\n<p>In your own writing, pay attention to the words you use. Are you using the best adjective? Is there a more appropriate noun that matches your tone or the mood you want to create? Don't worry too much about word choice when writing your first draft. Structure your post, do a round or two of editing, and <em>then</em> zoom in on revising specific phrases and words.</p>\n<h2>Links support stats and information.</h2>\n<p>Lastly, Pamela supports her post with links to external sources, but doesn't overwhelm readers with <em>too many </em>links—it is possible to link too much! Many posts on WordPress.com—such as information-heavy pieces on science, politics, and history—include percentages, statistics, and monetary figures. Your discussions are stronger and more reliable when you cite and link to credible sources.</p>\n<p>For more posts from Pamela, visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://spacesforlearning.wordpress.com/\">A Space for Learning</a>.</p>\n<p>So, tell us: Do you think this is an appropriate selection for Freshly Pressed?</p>\n<p><em>For more on our Freshly Pressed content, check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/what-makes-a-post-freshly-press-able-the-rise-of-ebooks-evil-or-essential/\">last week’s Freshly Press-able post</a>, read our roundup of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/freshly-pressed-editors-picks-for-august-2012/\">Editors’ Picks for August</a>, or read <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/freshly-pressed/\">So You Want to Be Freshly Pressed</a>.</em></p>\n","excerpt":"<ul class=\"thumb-list\"><li><i style=\"background:url(http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/a-space-for-learning-2.jpeg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li><li><i style=\"background:url(http://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/curiosity-2.jpeg?crop=1&w=84&h=84) no-repeat center center #FFF; width:84px; height:84px\" class=\"size-thumb\" /></li></ul><p dir='auto'>Every day, 19 WordPressers are featured on the Freshly Pressed section of WordPress.com.
